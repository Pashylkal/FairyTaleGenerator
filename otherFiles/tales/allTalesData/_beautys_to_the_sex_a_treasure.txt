Still admir'd beyond all measure,And never yet was any known,By still admiring, weary grown.But that rare quality call'd grace,Exceeds, by far, a handsome face.Its lasting charms surpass the other,And this rich gift her kind godmotherBestow'd on Cinderilla fair,Whom she instructed with such care.She gave to her such graceful mien,That she, thereby, became a queen.For thus (may ever truth prevail)We draw our moral from this tale.This quality, fair ladies, knowPrevails much more (you'll find it so)T'ingage and captivate a heart,Than a fine head dress'd up with art.The fairies' gift of greatest worthIs grace of bearing, not high birth.Without this gift we'll miss the prize.Possession gives us wings to rise.__A great advantage 'tis, no doubt, to man,To have wit, courage, birth, good sense, and brain,And other such like qualities, which weReceiv'd from heaven's kind hand, and destiny.But none of these rich graces from above,To your advancement in the world will proveIf godmothers and sires you disobey,Or 'gainst their strict advice too long you stay._
