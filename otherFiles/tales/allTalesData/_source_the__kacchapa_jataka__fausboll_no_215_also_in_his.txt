H. D. Rouse, of Christ's College,Cambridge. There is a brief abstract of the Jataka in Prof. EstlinCarpenter's sermon, _Three Ways of Salvation_, 1884, p. 27, where myattention was first called to this Jataka._Parallels._ Most readers of these Notes will remember the centralepisode of Mr. J. C. Harris' _Uncle Remus_, in which Brer Fox, annoyedat Brer Rabbit's depredations, fits up "a contrapshun, what he calls aTar Baby." Brer Rabbit, coming along that way, passes the time of daywith Tar Baby, and, annoyed at its obstinate silence, hits it withright fist and with left, with left fist and with right, whichsuccessively stick to the "contrapshun," till at last he butts withhis head, and that sticks too, whereupon Brer Fox, who all this timehad "lain low," saunters out, and complains of Brer Rabbit that he istoo stuck up. In the sequel Brer Rabbit begs Brer Fox that he may"drown me as deep ez you please, skin me, scratch out my eyeballs,t'ar out my years by the roots, en cut off my legs, but do don't flingme in dat brier patch." which, of course, Brer Fox does, only to beinformed by the cunning Brer Rabbit that he had been "bred en bawn ina brier patch." The story is a favourite one with the negroes: itoccurs in Col. Jones' _Negro Myths of the Georgia Coast_ (Uncle Remusis from S. Carolina), also among those of Brazil (Romero, _Contos doBrazil_), and in the West Indian Islands (Mr. Lang, "At the Sign ofthe Ship," _Longman's Magazine_, Feb. 1889). We can trace it toAfrica, where it occurs in Cape Colony (_South African Folk LoreJournal_, vol. i.)._Remarks._ The five fold attack on the Demon and the Tar Baby is sopreposterously ludicrous that it cannot have been independentlyinvented, and we must therefore assume that they are causallyconnected, and the existence of the variant in South Africa clinchesthe matter, and gives us a landing stage between India and America.There can be little doubt that the Jataka of Prince Five Weapons cameto Africa, possibly by Buddhist missionaries, spread among thenegroes, and then took ship in the holds of slavers for the New World,where it is to be found in fuller form than any yet discovered in thehome of its birth. I say Buddhist missionaries, because there is acertain amount of evidence that the negroes have Buddhistic symbolsamong them, and we can only explain the identification of Brer Rabbitwith Prince Five Weapons, and so with Buddha himself, by supposing thechange to have originated among Buddhists, where it would be quitenatural. For one of the most celebrated metempsychoses of Buddha isthat detailed in the _Sasa Jataka_ (Fausboll, No. 316, tr. R.Morris, _Folk Lore Journal_, ii. 336), in which the Buddha, as a hare,performs a sublime piece of self sacrifice, and as a reward istranslated to the moon, where he can be seen to this day as "the harein the moon." Every Buddhist is reminded of the virtue ofself sacrifice whenever the moon is full, and it is easy to understandhow the Buddha became identified as the Hare or Rabbit. A strikingconfirmation of this, in connection with our immediate subject, isoffered by Mr. Harris' sequel volume, _Nights with Uncle Remus_. Herethere is a whole chapter (xxx.) on "Brer Rabbit and his famous Foot,"and it is well known how the worship of Buddha's foot developed inlater Buddhism. No wonder Brer Rabbit is so 'cute: he is nothing lessthan an incarnation of Buddha. Among the Karens of Burmah, whereBuddhist influence is still active, the Hare holds exactly the sameplace in their folk lore as Brer Rabbit among the negroes. The sixthchapter of Mr. Smeaton's book on them is devoted to "FiresideStories," and is entirely taken up with adventures of the Hare, all ofwhich can be parallelled from _Uncle Remus_.Curiously enough, the negro form of the five fold attack "fightingwith _five_ fists," Mr. Barr would call it is probably nearer to theoriginal legend than that preserved in the Jataka, though 2000 yearsolder. For we may be sure that the thunderbolt of Knowledge did notexist in the original, but was introduced by some Buddhist Mr. Barlow,who, like Alice's Duchess, ended all his tales with: "And the moral ofthat is  " For no well bred demon would have been taken in by sosimple a "sell" as that indulged in by Prince Five Weapons in ourJataka, and it is probable, therefore, that _Uncle Remus_ preserves areminiscence of the original Indian reading of the tale. On the otherhand, it is probable that Carlyle's Indian god with the fire in hisbelly was derived from Prince Five Weapons.The negro variant has also suggested to Mr. Batten an explanation ofthe whole story which is extremely plausible, though it introduces amethod of folk lore exegesis which has been overdriven to death. The_Sasa Jataka_ identifies the Brer Rabbit Buddha with the hare inthe moon. It is well known that Easterns explain an eclipse of themoon as due to its being swallowed up by a Dragon or Demon. May not,asks Mr. Batten, the _Pancavudha Jataka_ be an idealised account ofan eclipse of the moon? This suggestion receives strong confirmationfrom the Demon's reference to Rahu, who does, in Indian myth swallowthe moon at times of eclipse. The Jataka accordingly contains theBuddhist explanation why the moon _i.e._ the hare in the moon, _i.e._Buddha is not altogether swallowed up by the Demon of Eclipse, theDemon with the Matted Hair. Mr. Batten adds that in imagining whatkind of Demon the Eclipse Demon was, the Jataka writer was probablyaided by recollections of some giant octopus, who has saucer eyes anda kind of hawk's beak, knobs on its "tusks," and a very variegatedbelly (gasteropod). It is obviously unfair of Mr. Batten both toillustrate and also to explain so well the Tar Baby Jataka taking thescientific bread, so to speak, out of a poor folk lorist's mouth buthis explanations seem to me so convincing that I cannot avoidincluding them in these Notes.I am, however, not so much concerned with the original explanation ofthe Jataka as to trace its travels across the continents of Asia,Africa, and America. I think I have done this satisfactorily, and willhave thereby largely strengthened the case for less extensive travelsof other tales. I have sufficient confidence of the method employed toventure on that most hazardous of employments, scientific prophecy. Iventure to predict that the Tar Baby story will be found in Madagascarin a form nearer the Indian than Uncle Remus, and I will go further,and say that it will _not_ be found in the grand Helsingforscollection of folk tales, though this includes 12,000, of which 1000are beast tales._Source._ Knowles, _Folk Tales of Kashmir_, pp. 211 25, with someslight omissions.

Therhymes are to the effect that a father who gives up his wealth to hischildren in his own lifetime deserves to be put to death with themallet. Mr. Gomme gives evidence that it was an archaic custom to putoldsters to death after they had become helpless. He also points outthat it was customary for estates to be divided and surrendered duringthe owners' lifetime, and generally he connects a good deal ofprimitive custom with our story. I have already pointed out in_Folk Lore_, p. 403, that the existence of the tale in Kashmir withoutany reference to the mallet makes it impossible for the rhymes on themallet to be the source of the story. As a matter of fact, it is avery embarrassing addition to it, since the rhyme tells against theparent, and the story is intended to tell against the ungratefulchildren. The existence of the tale in India renders it likely enoughthat it is not indigenous to the British Isles, but an Orientalimportation. It is obvious, therefore, that it cannot be used asanthropological evidence of the existence of the primitive customs tobe found in it. The whole incident, indeed, is a striking example ofthe dangers of the anthropological method of dealing with folk talesbefore some attempt is made to settle the questions of origin anddiffusion._Source._ The _Lola Jataka_, Fausboll, No. 274, kindly translatedand slightly abridged for this book by Mr. W.

I should perhaps add that the Bodhisat is notprecisely the Buddha himself but a character which is on its way tobecoming perfectly enlightened, and so may be called a future Buddha.The Happy Prince.
