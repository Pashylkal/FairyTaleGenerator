Once upon a time, way back in the middle ages, the clan MacLeod was a verystrong clan in Scotland, and the fairies or "little people" favored itmuch. So the queen of the fairies gave to the chief a wonderful flag whichpossessed the quality of granting them three wishes, but only in time ofgreat need. The flag was carefully laid away and not brought out for along while.At last there was great woe at Dunvegan, the castle of the MacLeods, forthe heir was lost. Then someone thought of the flag and it was used, andsoon after the boy was found.A second time it was used to save the chief from death, and carefully laidaway again, but, alas, so carefully that it could not be found till, in1799, an iron chest that seemed keyless was broken open and found tocontain an inner case in which was a scented casket, in that the fairyflag.Now, before the finding of the flag a seer had predicted that when thethird Norman son of an English lady should perish accidentally, the"Maidens" (three large rocks in the ocean belonging to MacLeod) should besold to the Campbells. a fox should litter in the castle. and the fairyflag be found. The glory of the MacLeods would then depart, but to be morethan recovered in the future when another chief called Ian Breac shouldarise.In 1799 all these things happened, but at the present time the heirpresumptive is called Ian Breac, so it is to be hoped that the glory ofthe MacLeod's will return.The fairy flag is still shown at Dunvegan Castle, on the Isle of Skye. Itis of fine yellow silk and has many so called "elf marks" on it in redsilk thread.Lovers of Scott's poems will recognize these lines of his translation of"Mackrimmon's Lament," an old song composed by a piper of the clanMacLeod:MacLeod's wizard flag from the gray castle sallies,The rowers are seated,Unmoored are the galleys.I have before me, as I write, a letter from the twenty third chief of theclan, in which he tells me that though the belief in fairies is probablygone, the flag is still there to convince people of this tradition.
