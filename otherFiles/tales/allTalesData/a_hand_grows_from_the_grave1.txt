In the church at Lunow, three quarters of a mile from Oderberg, there is achopped off, dried up hand on display. It is clenched into a fist andholds aswitch between its fingers. It comes from a son who in a godless mannerhadonce struck his father. God himself punished him, for when he died andwasburied, his hand emerged from the grave.However often they reburied it, it always reappeared. Finally they beatit witha switch, thinking that it would then return to beneath the earth, butthat didnot help. Therefore they chopped off the hand, put the switch in itsfist, andplaced it in the church at Lunow as an eternal warning to godlesschildren.
