Two farm workers slept together in one room. One of them was ridden bya mahrt so often that he finally asked his comrade the next time ithappened to stop up the knothole in the door so they could capture themahrt.The next time he was miserably moaning and groaning in his sleep, hiscomrade did what he had been asked, then called his friend by name.Awakening, he quickly reached out and grabbed a piece of straw in hishand. Although it twisted and turned, he held it tightly until his comradehad stopped up the knothole. He then laid the piece of straw on the table,and they both fell asleep until morning.When they awoke they saw a beautiful girl behind the stove. They nearlyparted ways disputing whom she belonged to. The one who had stopped up theknothole said that she should be his, because if he had not done that, shewould have escaped. The other one said that she belonged to him, becausehe had captured her.Finally the one who stopped up the knothole gave in, and the other onemarried the girl. They had children and lived together quite happily.However, the woman often begged her husband to show her the knotholewhere she had entered the room. She said that she would have no peaceuntil she had seen it. The man resisted her pleas for a long time, butonce she begged him especially earnestly, saying that she could hear hermother in England calling the pigs, and asked him to allow see her againjust once.Finally he softened and gave in. He went with her and showed her whereshe had entered the room, but in that instant she flew out through theknothole and never returned.
