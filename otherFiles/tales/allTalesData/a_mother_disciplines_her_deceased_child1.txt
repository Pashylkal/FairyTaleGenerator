In a house in Obwalden there once lived an eight or nine year old childwho was very disobedient and rebellious. The mother recognized her child'sstubbornness but could not find it in her heart to discipline him. Thusthis child lived for some time and did many bad things.Then he took sick and died. After the burial the child broke throughhis coffin and stuck his right arm out of the grave, causing fear andamazement among the people. The parents attempted everything to get theirchild to pull his arm back, but nothing helped.Finally someone said to the deeply concerned parents, "You spared therod too much. As punishment for this, the mother must go to the graveevery day and beat the hand with a switch until he pulls it back."The mother did this, and this course of action brought the desiredresults.
