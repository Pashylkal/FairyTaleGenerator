The Fairy Faith in Celtic CountriesForty to fifty years ago, between St. John's and Foxdale (Isle of Man), aboy, with whom I often played, came to our house at nightfall to borrowsome candles, and while he was on his way home across the hills hesuddenly saw a little boy and a little woman coming after him. If heran, they ran, and all the time they gained on him. Upon reaching homehe was speechless, his hand were altered (turned awry), and his feetalso, and his fingernails had grown long in a minute. He remained thatway a week.My father went to the boy's mother and told her it wasn't Robby at allthat she saw. and when my father was for taking the tongs and burning theboy with a piece of glowing turf (as a changeling test), the boy screamedawfully. Then my father persuaded the mother to send a messenger to adoctor in the north near Ramsey "doing charms," to see if she couldn'tget Robby back. As the messenger was returning, the mother stepped outof the house to relieve him, and when she went into the house again herown Robby was there.As soon as Robby came to himself all right, he said a little woman and alittle boy had followed him, and that just as he got home he wasconscious of being taken away by them, but he didn't know where they camefrom nor where they took him. He was unable to tell more than this.Robby is alive yet, so far as I know. he is Robert Christian, of Douglas.
