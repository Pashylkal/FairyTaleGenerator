on the GallowsNow and then there are widows who are not only happy that theirhusbands have died, but even those who fail to protect their deadhusbands' bodies beneath the earth in order quickly to gain anotherhusband.The story is told of a soldier who   under penalty of death   hadbeen ordered to keep watch over the corpse of a distinguished gentlemanwho had been hanged. The gallows stood near a graveyard where the body ofa widow's husband lay buried. Following his burial this woman came to thegrave several nights in a row, where she wept and pitifully bemoaned herhusband's death. The soldier heard her cries and came to console her.Upon his return, however, he discovered that the hanged man he wassupposed to be guarding had been stolen. Bad luck! Quickly he ran back andsaid, "What can I do, pious woman? While I was consoling you, someonestole my thief from the gallows, and now I'll be hanged in his place.""Be comforted, soldier! Will you marry me if I can solve yourproblem?""Of course. You have my promise!""Then hurry and help me. We will dig up my dead husband and hang him onthe gallows in the place of the stolen corpse."With the soldier's help the dead man was dug up, but then the soldiersaid, "He doesn't look like the stolen corpse. His teeth are toolong.""We can fix that," said the widow, whereupon she picked up a stone,knocked out her dead husband's teeth, and then helped hang him up.Afterward she asked the soldier to marry her, as he had promised."No," said the soldier. "I don't like you, and I won't have you. Youcan go to the devil. After the way you treated your dead husband, howwould you treat me, your living husband?"
