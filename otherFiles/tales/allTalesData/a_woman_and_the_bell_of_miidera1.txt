In the ancient monastery of Miidera there was a great bronze bell. Itrang out every morning and evening, a clear, rich note, and its surfaceshone like sparkling dew. The priests would not allow any woman tostrike it, because they thought that such an action would pollute anddull the metal, as well as bring calamity upon them.When a certain pretty woman who lived in Kyoto heard this, she grewextremely inquisitive, and at last, unable to restrain her curiosity, shesaid: "I will go and see this wonderful bell of Miidera. I will make itsend forth a soft note, and in its shining surface, bigger and brighterthan a thousand mirrors, I will paint and powder my face and dress myhair."At length this vain and irreverent woman reached the belfry in which thegreat bell was suspended, at a time when all were absorbed in theirsacred duties. She looked into the gleaming bell and saw her prettyeyes, flushed cheeks, and laughing dimples. Presently she stretchedforth her little fingers, lightly touched the shining metal, and prayedthat she might have as great and splendid a mirror for her own. When thebell felt this woman's fingers, the bronze that she touched shrank,leaving a little hollow, and losing at the same time all its exquisitepolish.
