There was once a man named Ahlemann, and he had a wife and four children.One day he wanted to eat some liver, so he said, "Have it ready when Iarrive home from work."His wife went to town and bought a nice large liver. After it was fried,and the husband still hadn't come home, it smelled so good that wantedsome ever so much. Finally she sat down and tasted it herself. First sheate just a very little piece, thinking, "He will never notice it." Butthen she cut off another little piece, and soon the entire liver was gone.Then she became terribly frightened that her husband would scold her, soshe ran to the gallows where someone was hanging whom they had hanged ashort time ago. She cut out his liver and fried it.When Ahlemann came home he sat down, and it tasted marvelous. Afterward hewent for beer with his children.Evening came, and it was already dark. The woman was lying in her bed whenshe heard something approaching her room. A voice called out, "Where isAh lemann? Where is Ah lemann?"She said, "Ahlemann has gone for beer with all four!"But she heard it coming closer and closer, and she called out in fear,"Come Ah lemann. come Ah lemann. I am terribly afraid."But it was to no avail. Suddenly it was standing before her bed, and itbroke her neck.
