Ages ago the cruel custom ruled of entombing infants in the foundations ofcastles and fortresses in order to provide protection against storms,weather, and the dangers of war. The infants were purchased from theirmothers for large sums of money. Once a fortified castle was to be thuslybuilt in the Stargard region. An infant had already been purchased.Before committing the cruel deed, the masons who had been engaged for theconstruction were talking with one another: "What is sweeter than amother's nipple?"The answer came to them from the infant's mouth: "The grace of God!"Taken aback, the workmen laid down their tools and refused to proceed withthe wicked building.The castle was never completed.
