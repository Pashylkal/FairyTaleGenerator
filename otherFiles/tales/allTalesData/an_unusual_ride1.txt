A man was riding home on his donkey, while his boy walked beside them. Atraveler came along and said, "Father, it is not right for you to ridewhile you make your boy walk. You have stronger limbs."So the father climbed off the donkey and let his son ride. Anothertraveler came along and said, "Boy, it is not right for you to ride whileyou make your father go on foot. You have younger legs."So they both mounted the donkey and road on a little way. A third travelercame along and said, "How stupid! Two fellows on one weak animal.Someone should take a stick and knock you off its back!"So they both climbed off, and all three went along on foot, the father andson left and right, and the donkey in the middle. A fourth traveler camealong and said, "You are three strange companions. Isn't it enough if twoof you were to go on foot? Wouldn't it be easier if one of youwould ride?"So the father tied the donkey's front legs together, and the son tied itsback legs together. Then they put a strong pole that was lying beside theroad through its legs and carried the donkey home on their shoulders.That's how far it can go if one tries to please everyone.
