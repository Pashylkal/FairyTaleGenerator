In Damsdorf many years ago a number of boys were herding cattle in afield. One Sunday morning Farmer Bruhnke was suddenly overcome by anuncanny fear, and he rushed out to the field to see what the herders weredoing. He had scarcely left the village when a little man came his way whoasked him where he was going. Bruhnke told him, and the little man repliedthat he had just passed the boys, who were passing the time by playing agame.Bruhnke was relieved, but as he took leave of the little man, henoticed that the latter had a hen's foot. He ran as fast as his feet wouldcarry him to the herding place, but it was too late. The head of one ofthe herders was already dancing on the ground.The boys had wanted to see how beheading went. To this end they builtthemselves an actual guillotine, fastening an old blade from a strawcutter onto a platform to serve as an ax. They all tried it, but just asthey tied the last one to the block, a three legged hare came limping by,and the boys ran after it, completely forgetting their comrade and thecattle. The prisoner tried to free himself of his bonds, but his motionsreleased the blade, and the unfortunate boy paid for his game with hislife.
