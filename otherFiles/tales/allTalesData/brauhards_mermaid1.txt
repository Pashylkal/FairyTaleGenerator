Many years ago a man named Brauhard lived in Lauterberg. He had beenfar away across the water and had brought home a mermaid, whom he married.Her top half was human, but her bottom half was formed like a fish. Shelived in a tub in his house. However, his friends could not stand themalformed woman, and so they finally poisoned her. He did not remarry, andhe contributed the money he had received as her dowry to the poor. That isthe source of the Brauhard Fund which to this day is administered by theScharzfeld Jurisdiction for the support of the poor in the surroundingvillages.
