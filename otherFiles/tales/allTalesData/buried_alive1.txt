Many years ago an epidemic swept over Dalland, to which thousands ofpersons fell victims. Many people fled to the forests, or to otherregions. The churches were deserted, and those remaining were not enoughto bury the dead. At this stage an old Finlander came along, who informedthe few survivors that they need not hope for cessation of the scourgeuntil they had buried some living thing.The advice was followed. First a cock was buried alive, but the plaguecontinued as violent as ever. Next, a goat, but this also provedineffectual. At last a poor boy, who frequented the neighborhood, begging,was lured to a wood covered hill at the point where the river Daleborgempties into Lake Venem. Here a deep hole was dug, the boy meantimesitting near, enjoying a piece of bread and butter that had been givenhim.When the grave was deep enough, the boy was dropped into it and thediggers began hurriedly to shovel the dirt upon him. The lad begged andprayed them not to throw dirt upon his bread and butter, but the spadesflew faster, and in a few minutes, still alive, he was entirely coveredand left to his fate.Whether this stayed the plague is not know, but many who after nightpass the hill, hear, it is said, a voice as if from a dying child, crying,"Buried alive! Buried Alive!"
