A man wanted to select a wife for himself from among three sisters, allof whom pleased him greatly. He invited them all to eat their noon mealwith him at an inn. Wanting to find himself an industrious and efficienthousewife, he decided to test them on how they ate cheese.When her cheese was served the eldest cut the rind off so thick that itincluded a lot of good cheese, which was thus lost. "She will waste toomuch and throw out everything," thought the man. "You cannot chooseher."Then the second sister received her cheese, and she ate her piecewithout cutting off any of the rind. "She is not the wife for you either,"thought the man. "She will be disorderly."Then the youngest sister was served her cheese. She scraped her pieceoff cleanly and carefully, and then ate it. Thus the suitor thought, "Sheis the right one!" and he did indeed marry her.
