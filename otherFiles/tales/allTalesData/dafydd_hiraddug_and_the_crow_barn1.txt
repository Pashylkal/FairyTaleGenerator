There is an incredible tradition connected with this place, Ffinant,Trefeglwys. It is said that an old barn stands on the right hand side ofthe highway.One Sunday morning, as the master was starting to church, he told oneof the servants to keep the crows from a field that had been sown withwheat, in which field the old barn stood. The servant, through some means,collected all the crows into the barn, and shut the door on them. He thenfollowed his master to the church, who, when he saw the servant there,began to reprove him sharply. But the master, when he heard the strangenews, turned his steps homewards, and found to his amazement that the talewas true, and it is said that the barn was filled with crows. This barnever afterwards was called Crow Barn , a name it still retains.It is said that the servant's name was Dafydd Hiraddug, and that he hadsold himself to the devil, and that consequently, he was able to performfeats, which in this age are considered incredible.However, it is said that Dafydd was on this occasion more subtle thanthe old serpent, even according to the agreement which was between them.The contract was, that the devil was to have complete possession of Dafyddif his corpse were taken over the side of the bed, or through a door, orif buried in a churchyard, or inside a church. Dafydd had commanded, thaton his death, the liver and lights were to be taken out of his body andthrown on the dunghill, and notice was to be taken whether a raven or adove got possession of them. if a raven, then his body was to be takenaway by the foot, and not by the side of the bed, and through the wall,and not through the door, and he was to be buried, not in the churchyardnor in the church but under the church walls. And the devil, when he sawthat by these arrangements he had been duped cried, saying:Dafydd Hiraddug, badly bred,False when living, and false when dead.
