Cupid, one sultry summer's noon, tired with play and faint with heat, wentinto a cool grotto to repose himself. Thishappened to be the cave of Death. He threw himself carelessly down uponthe floor, and his quiver turning upside down,all the arrows fell out and mingled with those of Death, which layscattered about the place. When he awoke hegathered them up as well as he could. but they were so intermingled thatalthough he knew the proper number to take,he could not rightly distinguish his own. Hence he took up some of thearrows which belonged to Death, and left someof his. This is the reason why that we now and then see the hearts of theold and decrepit transfixed with the boltsof Love. and with great grief and surprise sometimes see youth and beautysmitten with the darts of Death.Moral: Death and Love strike unexpectedly.
