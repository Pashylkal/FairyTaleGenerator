Death, of course, is not always looked upon as punishment. In fact, inmany religious stories virtuous people (often children) are "called home,"frequently under miraculous circumstances. For these blessed individuals,death is a divine release from the sorrows of this world.Once there was a poor woman who had two children. The youngestone had to go into the forest every day to find wood. Once a little childhelped him gather the wood, carried it to the house, and then disappeared.The child told his mother about the helper, but she didn't believe him.One day the helper child brought a rose and told the child that when therose was in full blossom he would come again. The mother put the rose intosome water. One morning the child did not get up. the mother went to hisbed and found him lying there dead. On that same morning the rose cameinto full blossom.Source: Retold from The Rose (Grimm, Children's Legends,no. 3). For similar accounts of foretold deaths, see Grimm, GermanLegends, nos. 263 267.Religious legends are told throughout the world, and those describingpremonitions and forewarnings of impending death are particularlywidespread and persistent. Such accounts spontaneously emerge at solemnfamily gatherings, then disappear when the mood brightens. They surfaceagain when needed   unrehearsed at other sober occasions, orsophisticatedly refined in universal myths and in the great tragedies ofworld literature. At their primeval level, these accounts describe onlymodest miracles: the opening of a flower, the appearance of a bird, thedream of a departed loved one, or perhaps nothing more portentous than anuncanny feeling. They do not claim the power to change the course of humandestiny, nor do they offer explanations to life's unfathomed mysteries.Instead, they are expressions of faith in continuity and of hope forjustice, even at times when it is painfully evident that, on this earth atleast, we do not live happily ever after.
