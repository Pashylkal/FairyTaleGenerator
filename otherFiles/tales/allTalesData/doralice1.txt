Tebaldo, Prince of Salerno, wishes to have hisonly daughter Doralice to wife, but she, through her father's persecution,flees to England, where she marries Genese the king, and has by him twochildren. These, having been slain by Tebaldo, are avenged by their fatherKing Genese.I cannot think there is one amongst us who has not realized by his ownexperience how great is the power of love, and how sharp are the arrows heis wont to shoot into our corruptible flesh. He, like a mighty king,directs and governs his empire without a sword, simply by his individualwill, as you will be able to understand from the tenor of the story whichI about to tell to you.You must know, dear ladies, that Tebaldo, Prince of Salerno, accordingto the story I have heard repeated many times by my elders, had to wife amodest and prudent lady of good lineage, and by her he had a daughter whoin beauty and grace outshone all the other ladies of Salerno. but it wouldhave been well for Tebaldo if she had never seen the light, for in thatcase the grave misadventure which befell him would never have happened.His wife, young in years but of mature wisdom, when she lay a dyingbesought her husband, whom she loved very dearly, never to take for hiswife any woman whose finger would not exactly fit the ring which sheherself wore. and the prince, who loved his wife no less than she lovedhim, swore by his head that he would observe her wish.After the good princess had breathed her last and had been honorablyburied, Tebaldo indulged in the thought of wedding again, but he bore wellin mind the promise he had made to his wife, and was firmly resolved tokeep her saying.However, the report that Tebaldo, Prince of Salerno, was seekinganother mate soon got noised abroad, and came to the ears of many maidenswho, in worth and in estate, were no whit his inferiors. but Tebaldo,whose first care was to fulfil the wishes of his wife who was dead, madeit a condition that any damsel who might be offered to him in marriageshould first try on her finger his wife's ring, to see whether it fitted,and not having found one who fulfilled this condition   the ring beingalways found too big for this and too small for that   he was forced todismiss them all without further parley.Now it happened one day that the daughter of Tebaldo, whose name wasDoralice, sat at table with her father. and she, having espied hermother's ring lying on the board, slipped it on her finger and cried out,"See my father, how well my mother's ring fits me!" And the prince, whenhe saw what she had done, assented.But not long after this the soul of Tebaldo was assailed by a strangeand diabolical temptation to take to wife his daughter Doralice, and formany days he lived tossed about between yea and nay. At last, overcome bythe strength of this devilish intent, and fired by the beauty of themaiden, he one day called her to him and said, "Doralice, my daughter,while your mother was yet alive, but fast nearing the end of her days, shebesought me never to take to wife any woman whose finger would not fit thering she herself always wore in her lifetime, and I swore by my head thatI would observe this last request of hers. Wherefore, when I felt the timewas come for me to wed anew, I made trial of many maidens, but not onecould I find who could wear your mother's ring, except yourself. ThereforeI have decided to take you for my wife, for thus I shall satisfy my owndesire without violating the promise I made to your mother."Doralice, who was as pure as she was beautiful, when she listened tothe evil designs of her wicked father, was deeply troubled in her heart.but, taking heed of his vile and abominable lust, and fearing the effectsof his rage, she made no answer and went out of his presence with anuntroubled face.As there was no one whom she could trust so well as her old nurse, sherepaired to her at once as the surest bulwark of her safety, to takecounsel as to what she should do. The nurse, when she had heard the storyof the execrable lust of this wicked father, spake words of comfort toDoralice, for she knew well the constancy and steadfast nature of thegirl, and that she would be ready to endure any torment rather than accedeto her father's desire, and promised to aid her in keeping her virginityunsullied by such terrible disgrace.After this the nurse thought of nothing else than how she might bestfind a way for Doralice out of this strait, planning now this and nowthat, but finding no method which gained her entire approval. She wouldfain have had Doralice take to flight and put long distance betwixt herand her father, but she feared the craft of Tebaldo, and lest the girlshould fall into his hands after her flight, feeling certain that in suchevent he would put her to death.So while the faithful nurse was thus taking counsel with herself, shesuddenly hit upon a fresh scheme, which was what I will now tell you. Inthe chamber of the dead lady there was a fair cassone, or clothes chest,magnificently carved, in which Doralice kept her richest dresses and hermost precious jewels, and this wardrobe the nurse alone could open. So sheremoved from it by stealth all the robes and the ornaments that weretherein, and bestowed them elsewhere, placing in it a good store of acertain liquor which had such great virtue, that whosoever took a spoonfulof it, or even less, could live for a long time without furthernourishment.Then, having called Doralice, she shut her therein, and bade her remainin hiding until such time as God should send her better fortune, and herfather be delivered from the bestial mood which had come upon him.The maiden, obedient to the good old woman's command, did all that wastold her. and the father, still set upon his accursed design, and makingno effort to restrain his unnatural lust, demanded every day what hadbecome of his daughter. and, neither finding any trace of her, or knowingaught where she could be, his rage became so terrible that he threatenedto have her killed as soon as he should find her.Early one morning it chanced that Tebaldo went into the room where thechest was, and as soon as his eye fell upon it, he felt, from theassociations connected with it, that he could not any longer endure thesight of it, so he gave orders that it should straightway be taken out andplaced elsewhere and sold, so that its presence might not bee an offenceto him. The servants were prompt to obey their master's command, and,having taken the thing on their shoulders, they bore it away to themarketplace. It chanced that there was at that time in the city a richdealer from Genoa, who, as soon as he caught sight of the sumptuouslycarved cassone, admired it greatly, and settled with himself that he wouldnot let it go from him, however much he might have to pay for it. So,having accosted the servant who was charged with the sale of it, andlearnt the price demanded, he bought it forthwith, and gave orders to aporter to carry it away and place it on board his ship.The nurse, who was watching the trafficking from a distance, was wellpleased with the issue thereof, though she grieved sore at losing themaiden. Wherefore she consoled herself by reflecting that when it comes tothe choice of evils it is ever wiser to avoid the greater.The merchant, having set sail from Salerno with his carven chest andother valuable wares, voyaged to the island of Britain, known to us todayas England, and landed at a port near which the country was spread out ina vast plain.Before he had been there long, Genese, who had lately been crowned kingof the island, happened to be riding along the seashore, chasing a finestag, which, in the end, ran down to the beach and took to the water.The king, feeling wary and worn with the long pursuit, was fain to restawhile, and, having caught sight of the ship, he sent to ask the master ofit to give him something to drink. and the latter, feigning to be ignoranthe was talking to the king, greeted Genese familiarly, and gave him ahearty welcome, finally prevailing upon him to go on board his vessel.The king, when he saw the beautiful clothes chest so finely carved, wastaken with a great longing to possess it, and grew so impatient to call ithis own that every hour seemed like a thousand till he should be able toclaim it. He then asked the merchant the price he asked for it, and wasanswered that the price was a very heavy one. The king, being now moretaken than ever with the beautiful handicraft, would not leave the shiptill he had arranged a price with the merchant, and, having sent for moneyenough to pay the price demanded, he took his leave, and straightwayordered the cassone to be borne to the palace and placed in his chamber.Genese, being yet over young to wive, found his chief pleasure in goingevery day to the chase. Now that the cassone was transported into hisbedroom, with the maiden Doralice hidden inside, she heard, as was onlynatural, all that went on in the king's chamber, and, in pondering overher past misfortunes, hoped that a happier future was in store for her.And as soon as the king had departed for the chase in the morning, and hadleft the room clear, Doralice would issue from the clothes chest, andwould deftly put the chamber in order, and sweep it, and make the bed.Then she would adjust the bed curtains, and put on the coverlet cunninglyembroidered with fine pearls, and two beautifully ornamented pillowsthereto. After this, the fair maiden strewed the bed with roses, violets,and other sweet smelling flowers, mingled with Cyprian spices whichexhaled a subtle odor and soothed the brain to slumber.Day after day Doralice continued to compose the king's chamber in thispleasant fashion, without being seen of anyone, and thereby gave Genesemuch gratification. for every day when he came back from the chase itseemed to him as if he was greeted by all the perfumes of the East.One day he questioned the queen his mother, and the ladies who wereabout her, as to which of them had so kindly and graciously adorned hisroom and decked the bed with roses and violets and sweet scents. Theyanswered, one and all, that they had no part in all this, for everymorning, when they went to put the chamber in order, they found the bedstrewn with flowers and perfumes.Genese, when he heard this, determined to clear up the mystery, and thenext morning gave out that he was going to hunt at a village ten leaguesdistant. But, in lieu of going forth, he quietly hid himself in the room,keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the door, and waiting to see what mightoccur. He had not been long on the watch before Doralice, looking morebeautiful than the sun, came out of the cassone and began to sweep theroom, and to straighten the carpets, and to deck the bed, and diligentlyto set everything in order, as was her wont.The beautiful maiden had no sooner done her kindly and considerateoffice, than she made as if she would go back to her hiding place. But theking, who had keenly taken note of everything, suddenly caught her by thehand, and, seeing that she was very fair, and fresh as a lily, asked herwho she was. whereupon the trembling girl confessed that she was thedaughter of a prince. She declared, however, that she had forgotten whatwas his name, on account of her long imprisonment in the cassone, and shewould say nothing as to the reason why she had been shut therein. Theking, after he had heard her story, fell violently in love with her, and,with the full consent of his mother, made her his queen, and had by hertwo fair children.In the meantime Tebaldo was still mastered by his wicked andtreacherous passion, and, as he could find no trace of Doralice, search ashe would, he began to believe that she must have been hidden in the cofferwhich he had caused to be sold, and that, having escaped his power, shemight be wandering about from place to place.Therefore, with his rage will burning against her, he set himself totry whether perchance he might not discover her whereabouts. He attiredhimself as a merchant, and, having gathered together a great store ofprecious stones and jewels, marvelously wrought in gold, quitted Salernounknown to anyone, and scoured all the nations and countries round about,finally meeting by hazard the trader who had originally purchased theclothes chest. Of him he demanded whether he had been satisfied with hisbargain, and into whose hands the chest had fallen, and the trader repliedthat he had sold the cassone to the King of England for double the pricehe had given for it.Tebaldo, rejoicing at this news, made his way to England, and when hehad landed there and journeyed to the capital, he made a show of hisjewels and golden ornaments, amongst which were some spindles and distaffscunningly wrought, crying out the while, "Spindles and distaffs for sale,ladies."It chanced that one of the dames of the court, who was looking out of awindow, heard this and saw the merchant and his goods. whereupon she ranto the queen and told her there was below a merchant who had for sale themost beautiful golden spindles and distaffs that ever were seen. The queencommanded him to be brought into the palace, and he came up the stairsinto her presence, but she did not recognize him in his merchant's guise.Moreover, she was not thinking ever to behold her father again. butTebaldo recognized his daughter at once.The queen, when she saw how fair was the work of the spindles anddistaffs, asked of the merchant what price he put upon them."The prince is great," he answered, "but to you I will give one of themfor nothing, provided you suffer me to gratify a caprice of mine. This isthat I may be permitted to sleep one night in the same room as yourchildren."The good Doralice, in her pure and simple nature, never suspected theaccursed design of the feigned merchant, and, yielding to the persuasionof her attendants, granted his request.But before the merchant was led to the sleeping chamber, certain ladiesof the court deemed it wise to offer him a cup of wine well drugged tomake him sleep sound, and when night had come and the merchant seemedovercome with fatigue, one of the ladies conducted him into the chamber ofthe king's children, where there was prepared for him a sumptuous couch.Before she left him the lady said, "Good man, are you not thirsty?""Indeed I am," he replied. whereupon she handed him the drugged wine ina silver cup. But the crafty Tebaldo, while feigning to drink the wine,spilled it over his garments, and then lay down to rest.Now there was in the children's a side door through which it waspossible to pass into the queen's apartment. At midnight, when all wasstill, Tebaldo stole through this, and, going up to the bed beside whichthe queen had left her clothes, he took away a small dagger, which he hadmarked the day before hanging from her girdle. Then he returned to thechildren's room and killed them both with the dagger, which he immediatelyput back into its scabbard, all bloody as it was. And having opened awindow he let himself down by a cord.As soon as the shopmen of the city were astir, he went to a barber'sand had his long beard taken off, for fear he might be recognized, andhaving put on different clothes he walked about the city withoutapprehension.In the palace the nurses went, as soon as they awakened, to suckle thechildren. but when they came to the cradles they found them both lyingdead. Whereupon they began to scream and to weep bitterly, and to rendtheir hair and their garments, thus laying bare their breasts.The dreadful tiding came quickly to the ears of the king and queen, andthey ran barefooted and in their nightclothes to the spot, and when theysaw the dead bodies of the babes they wept bitterly. Soon the report ofthe murder of the two children was spread throughout the city, and, almostat the same time, it was rumored that there had just arrived a famousastrologer, who, by studying the courses of the various stars, could laybare the hidden mysteries of the past.When this came to the ears of the king, he caused the astrologer to besummoned forthwith, and, when he was come into the royal presence,demanded whether or not he could tell the name of the murderer of thechildren.The astrologer replied that he could, and whispering secretly in theking's ear he said, "Sire, let all the men and women of your court who arewont to wear a dagger at their side be summoned before you, and if amongstthese you shall find one whose dagger is befouled with blood in itsscabbard, that same will be the murderer of your children."Wherefore the king at once gave command that all his courtiers shouldpresent themselves, and, when they were assembled, he diligently searchedwith his own hands to see if any one of them might have a bloody dagger athis side, but he could find none. Then he returned to the astrologer  who was no other than Tebaldo himself   and told him how his quest hadbeen vain, and that all in the palace, save his mother and the queen, hadbeen searched.To which the astrologer replied, "Sire, search everywhere and respectno one, and then you will surely find the murderer."So the king searched first his mother, and then the queen, and when hetook the dagger which Doralice wore and drew it from the scabbard, hefound it covered with blood.Then the king, convinced by this proof, turned to the queen and said toher, "O, wicked and inhuman woman, enemy of your own flesh and blood,traitress to your own children! What desperate madness has led you to dyeyour hands in the blood of these babes? I swear that you shall suffer thefull penalty fixed for such a crime."But though the king in his rage would fain have sent her straightway toa shameful death, his desire for vengeance prompted him to dispose of herso that she might suffer longer and more cruel torment. Wherefore hecommanded that she should be stripped and thus naked buried up to her chinin the earth, and that she should be well fed in order that she mightlinger long and the worms devour her flesh while she still lived. Thequeen, seasoned to misfortune in the past, and conscious of her innocence,contemplated her terrible doom with calmness and dignity.Tebaldo, when he learned that the queen had been adjudged guilty andcondemned to a cruel death, rejoiced greatly, and, as soon as he had takenleave of the king, left England, quite satisfied with his work, andreturned secretly to Salerno. Arrived there, he told to the old nurse thewhole story of his adventures, and how Doralice had been sentenced todeath by her husband.As she listened, the nurse feigned to be as pleased as Tebaldo himself,but in her heart she grieved sorely, overcome by this love which she hadalways borne towards the princess, and the next morning she took horseearly and rode on day and night until she came to England.Immediately she repaired to the palace and went before the king, whowas giving public audience in the great hall, and, having thrown herselfat his feet, she demanded an interview on a matter which concerned thehonor of his crown. The king granted her request, and took her by the handand bade her rise.Then, when the rest of the company had gone and left them alone, thenurse thus addressed the king, "Sire, know that Doralice, your wife, is mychild. She is not, indeed, the fruit of my womb, but I nourished her atthese breasts. She is innocent of the deed which is laid to her charge,and for which she is sentenced to a lingering and cruel death. And you,when you shall have learnt everything, and laid your hand upon the impiousmurderer, and understood the reason which moved him to slay your children,you will assuredly show her mercy and deliver her from these bitter andcruel torments. And if you find that I speak falsely in this, I offermyself to suffer the same punishment which the wretched Doralice is nowenduring."Then the nurse set forth fully from beginning to end the whole historyof Doralice's past life. and the king, when he heard it, doubted not thetruth of it, but forthwith gave orders that the queen, who was now moredead than alive, should be taken out of the earth. which was done at once,and Doralice, after careful nursing and ministration by physicians, wasrestored to health.Next day King Genese stirred up through all his kingdom mightypreparations for war, and gathered together a great army, which hedispatched to Salerno. After a short campaign the city was captured, andTebaldo, bound hand and foot, taken back to England, where King Genese,wishing to know the whole sum of his guilt, had him put upon the rack,whereupon the wretched man made full confession.The next day he was conducted through the city in a cart drawn by fourhorses, and then tortured with red hot pincers like Gano di Magazza, andafter his body had been quartered, his flesh was thrown to be eaten ofravenous dogs.And this was the end of the impious wretch Tebaldo. And King Genese andDoralice his queen lived many years happily together, leaving at theirdeath divers children in their place.
