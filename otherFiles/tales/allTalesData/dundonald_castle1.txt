In Ayrshire, the following rhyme is prevalent, and is probably veryold:Donald DinBuilt his house without a pin,alluding to Dundonald Castle, the ancient seat of King Robert II, andnow the last remaining property in Ayrshire of the noble family who taketheir title from it. According to tradition, it was built by a hero namedDonald Din, or Din Donald, and constructed entirely of stone, without theuse of wood, a supposition countenanced by the appearance of the building,which consists of three distinct stories, arched over with strongstonework, the roof of one forming the floor of another.Donald, the builder, was originally a poor man, but had the faculty ofdreaming lucking dreams. Upon one occasion he dreamed, thrice in onenight, that if he were to go to London Bridge, he would become a wealthyman. He went accordingly, saw a man looking over the parapet of thebridge, whom he accosted courteously, and, after a little conversation,entrusted with the secret of the occasion of his coming to London Bridge.The stranger told him that he had made a very foolish errand, for hehimself had once had a similar vision, which direct him to go to a certainspot in Ayrshire, in Scotland, where he would find a vast treasure, and,for his part, he had never once thought of obeying the injunction.From his description of the spot, the sly Scotsman at once perceivedthat the treasure in question must be concealed in no other place than hisown humble kail yard (cabbage patch) at home, to which heimmediately repaired, in full expectation of finding it. Nor was hedisappointed. for, after destroying many good and promising cabbages, andcompletely cracking credit with his wife, who esteemed him mad, he found alarge potful of gold coin, with the proceeds of which he built a stoutcastle for himself, and became the founder of a flourishing family.
