The Hodja was invited to a banquet. Not wanting to be pretentious, hewore his everyday clothes, only to discover that everyone ignored him,including the host. So he went back home and put on his fanciest coat, andthen returned to the banquet. Now he was greeted cordially by everyone andinvited to sit down and eat and drink.When the soup was served to him he dunked the sleeve of his coat intothe bowl and said, "Eat, my coat, eat!"The startled host asked the Hodja to explain his strange behavior."When I arrived here wearing my other clothes," explained the Hodja,"no one offered me anything to eat or drink. But when I returned wearingthis fine coat, I was immediately offered the best of everything, so I canonly assume that it was the coat and not myself who was invited to yourbanquet."
