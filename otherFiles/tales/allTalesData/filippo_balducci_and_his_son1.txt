When Filippo Balducci lost his wife to death, he resolved to devotehimself and his young son to God. Consequently he gave his worldlypossessions to charity, then took his little son to the slopes of MountAsinaio, where they lived together in a cave, completely secluded from theways and temptations of the world. In this remote sanctuary, Filippotaught his son about God and the saints, protecting him always fromdistractions and sin.Only after the boy reached the age of eighteen did the father feel itsafe to expose him to the outside world."Surely," thought Filippo, "his years of devotion and prayer in thisplace of solitude will now defend him against the ways of the world." Andthe two of them, father and son, set off for the city of Florence.Everything was new and amazing for the son: houses, palaces, churches,horses, and people. Filled with amazement, he asked his father about everyunfamiliar thing, and Filippo dutifully provided names and explanationsfor all that they saw, that is, until they happened upon a party ofbeautiful young women. The boy, who until now had never beheld such asight, could not take his eyes from them."Do not look at them," warned Filippo."But what are they?" asked the son."Oh, they are just geese," replied Filippo, wanting to divert the boy'sattention from the young women."Please, father," begged the boy, "let me have one of those geese. Icould put something into its bill."No!" exclaimed the father. "Their bills are not where you think theyare, and they require special feeding. And furthermore they are evil!"Poor Filippo now regretted having taken his son from his protectivesanctuary, for even as he spoke, he realized that however clever hisresponses were, they were no match for the boy's natural inclinations.
