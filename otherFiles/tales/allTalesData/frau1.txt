TrudeOnce upon a time there was a small girl who was strong willed andforward, and whenever her parents said anything to her, she disobeyedthem. How could anything go well with her?One day she said to her parents: "I have heard so much about Frau Trude.Someday I want to go to her place. People say such amazing things areseen there, and such strange things happen there, that I have become verycurious.Her parents strictly forbade her, saying: "Frau Trude is a wicked womanwho commits godless acts. If you go there, you will no longer be ourchild.But the girl paid no attention to her parents and went to Frau Trude'splace anyway.When she arrived there, Frau Trude asked: "Why are you so pale?""Oh," she answered, trembling all over, "I saw something that frightenedme.""What did you see?""I saw a black man on your steps.""That was a charcoal burner.""Then I saw a green man.""That was a huntsman.""Then I saw a blood red man.""That was a butcher.""Oh, Frau Trude, it frightened me when I looked through your window andcould not see you, but instead saw the devil with a head of fire.""Aha!" she said. "So you saw the witch properly outfitted. I have beenwaiting for you and wanting you for a long time. Light the way for menow!"With that she turned to girl into a block of wood and threw it into thefire. When it was thoroughly aglow she sat down next to it, and warmedherself by it, saying: "It gives such a bright light!"
