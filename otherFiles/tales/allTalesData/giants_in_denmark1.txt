That the country of Denmark was once cultivated and worked by giants, isattested by the enormous stones attached to the barrows and caves of theancients. Should any man question that this is accomplished bysuperhuman force, let him look up at the tops of certain mountains andsay, if he knows, what man has carried such immense boulders up to theircrests.For anyone considering this marvel will mark that it is inconceivable howa mass, hardly at all or but with difficulty movable upon a level, couldhave been raised to so mighty a peak of so lofty a mountain by mere humaneffort, or by the ordinary exertion of human strength. But as towhether, after the deluge went forth, there existed giants who could dosuch deeds, or men endowed beyond others with bodily force, there isscant tradition to tell us.But, as our countrymen assert, even today there are those who dwell inthat rugged and inaccessible region to the north who, by thetransformable nature of their bodies, are granted the power of being nearor distant, and of appearing and vanishing in turn. The approach to thisregion, whose position and name are unknown, and which lacks allcivilization, but teems with peoples of monstrous strangeness, is besetwith perils of a fearful kind, and has seldom granted to those whoattempted it an unscathed return.
