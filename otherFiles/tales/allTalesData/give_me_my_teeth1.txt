Mr. Halliwell gives us, in his Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales ,the story of Teeny Tiny. In this a little old woman takes a bone from thechurchyard to make soup. She goes to bed, and puts the bone in thecupboard. During the night someone comes demanding the bone, and at lengththe terrified old woman gives it up.A similar story is told in Cornwall.An old lady had been to the churchin the sands of Perranzabuloe. Shefound, amidst the numerous remains of mortality, some very good teeth. Shepocketed these, and at night placed them on her dressing table beforegetting into bed. She slept, but was at length disturbed by someonecalling out, "Give me my teeth. Give me my teeth."At first, the lady took no notice of this, but the cry, "Give me myteeth," was so constantly repeated, that she, at last, in terror, jumpedout of bed, took the teeth from the dressing table, and, opening thewindow, flung them out, exclaiming, "Drat the teeth, take 'em!"They no sooner fell into the darkness on the road than hasty retreatingfootsteps were heard, and there were no more demands for the teeth.
