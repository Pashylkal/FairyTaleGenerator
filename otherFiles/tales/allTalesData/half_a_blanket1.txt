In France an old king, weak with age, gave his kingdom and all hislands to his son, who in return promised to personally care for him. Soonafterward the son took himself a wife, who did not like the father.Spitefully she said, "The old man is always coughing at the table untilit takes away all my pleasure in eating."So to please her, the son gave his father a place to lie beneath thestairs. For many years he lay there on a bed of hay and straw like onethey would make for the dogs.The queen gave birth to a son, who grew into a proud and virtuous lad.Recognizing the situation, he brought whatever food and drink he couldfind to his grandfather. One day the grandfather asked for an old horseblanket to protect him from the cold, and the virtuous youth ran off tofulfill his wish.In the stall he found a good horse blanket. He took it from the horseand ripped it in two. Seeing him, his father asked him what he was doingwith the horse blanket."I am taking half of it for your father's bed," he said. "The otherhalf I'll save for you when you are sleeping there where you now have yourfather locked in."
