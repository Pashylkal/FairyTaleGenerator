There is a lake known as Holy Lake near the village of Neuhoff not farfrom the Elbe River in the district of Wolmirstedt.At the time of Burkhard, the twenty seventh archbishop of Magdeburg,who served from the year 1295 to the year 1304, this lake was filled withspirits and ghosts. They often frightened the fishermen and boatsmen, andcaused them much harm, drowning and causing the miserable death of many aman. When Archbishop Burkhard, a very pious and God fearing man, heard ofthis, he went to the lake with great sincerity, and blessed the place,driving the evil spirits away, and they have never been seen thereagain.From that time until the present day the lake has been known as HolyLake.
