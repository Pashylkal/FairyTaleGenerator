"One time," said Uncle Remus, sighing heavily and settling himself back inhis seat with an air of melancholy resignation  " one time Brer Rabbitwuz gwine 'long down de road shakin' his big bushy tail, en feelin' des ezscrumpshus ez a bee martin wid a fresh bug."Here the old man paused and glanced at the little boy, but it was evidentthat the youngster had become so accustomed to the marvelous developmentsof Uncle Remus's stories, that the extraordinary statement made no unusualimpression upon him.Therefore the old man began again, and this time in a louder arid moreinsinuating tone: "One time ole man Rabbit, he wuz gwine 'long down deroad shakin' his long, bushy tail, en feelin' mighty biggity."This was effective."Great goodness, Uncle Remus!" exclaimed the little boy in open eyedwonder, "everybody knows that rabbits haven't got long, bushy tails."The old man shifted his position in his chair and allowed his venerablehead to drop forward until his whole appearance was suggestive of thedeepest dejection. and this was intensified by a groan that seemed to bethe result of great mental agony. Finally he spoke, but not as addressinghimself to the little boy."I notices dat dem fokes w'at makes a great 'miration 'bout w'at dey knowsis des de fokes w'ich you can't put no 'pennunce in w'en de 'cashun comeup. Yer one un urn now, en he done come en excuse me er 'lowin' datrabbits is got long, bushy tails, w'ich goodness knows ef I'd a dremp' it,I'd a whirl in en on dremp it""Well, but Uncle Remus, you said rabbits had long, bushy tails," repliedthe little boy. "Now you know you did.""Ef I ain't fergit it off'n my mine, I say dat ole Brer Rabbit wuz gwinedown de big road shakin' his long, bushy tail. Dat w'at I say, en dat Istan's by."The little boy looked puzzled, but he didn't say anything. After a whilethe old man continued: "Now, den, ef dat's 'greed ter, I'm gwine on, en eftain't 'greed ter, den I'm gwineter pick up my cane an look atter my ownintrust. I go wuk lyin' roun' yer dat's des natally gittin' moldy."The little boy still remained quiet, and Uncle mus proceeded: "One dayBrer Rabbit wuz gwine down de road shakin' his long, bushy tail, w'en whoshould he strike up wid but ole Brer Fox gwine amblin' long wid a bigstring er fish! W'en dey pass de time er day wid wunner nudder, BrerRabbit, he open up de confab, he did, en he ax Brer Fox whar he git datnice string er fish, en Brer Fox, he up'n 'spon' dat he kotch um, en BrerRabbit, he saw whar'bouts, en Brer Fox, he say down at de babtizin' creek,en Brer Rabbit he ax how, kaze in dem days dey wuz monstus fon' erminners, en Brer Fox, he sot down on a log, he did, en he up'n tell BrerRabbit dat all he gotter do fer ter git er big mess er minners is ter goter de creek atter sun down, en drap his tail in de water en set dar tweldaylight, en den draw up a whole armful er fishes, en dem w'at he don'twant, he kin fling back.

He make a pull, en he feel like he comin'in two, en he fetch nudder jerk, en lo en beholes, whar wuz his tail?"There was a long pause."Did it come off, Uncle Remus?" asked the little boy, presently."She did dat!" replied the old man with unction. "She did dat, and datw'at make all deze yer bob tail rabbits w'at you see hoppin' en skaddlin'thoo de woods.""Are they all that way just becaue the old Rabbit lost his tail in thecreek?" asked the little boy."Dat's it, honey," replied the old man. "Dat's w'at dey tells me. Looklike dey er bleedzd ter take atter der pa."
