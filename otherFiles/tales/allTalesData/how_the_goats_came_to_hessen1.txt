In olden, olden times, the land of Hessen was surrounded by greatforests which were inhabited by many wolves. Many a family of goatsattempted to enter the land, but were torn apart by the bloodthirstybeasts. One day a weak little kid goat was making his way toward Hessen.He had hardly entered the forest before a wolf confronted him and wantedto tear him to pieces.Filled with fear, the little kid said, "My mother is coming too."The wolf thought, "Don't spoil your appetite. The mother will be abetter meal for my hungry stomach." And he let the little animal pass inpeace.Sure enough, soon afterward the mother goat appeared. The wolf wasabout to pounce on her, when she   filled with fear   said, "My husbandis coming too.""Stop!" thought the wolf. "Her husband is larger and will be a bettermeal for you. Wait to eat until he comes."Finally the ram goat approached. The wolf's heart laughed inside hisbody when he saw the stately fellow. He was about to spring on him andgrab him by the throat when two things caught his attention: the ram'sspikes and his bag."Tell me, ram," what are those big spikes on your head, and what isthat bag for between your legs?""Oh," replied the ram, "the spikes are a pair of pistols, and the bagis where I carry my powder and lead."In that moment, as such animals often do, the ram rubbed his left hornagainst his flank. The wolf thought that he was loading his pistol, and hetook to flight. Thus the first family of goats arrived happily in the landof Hessen. Their descendents have multiplied so much that Hessen nowprovides the neighboring lands with its surplus every year.
