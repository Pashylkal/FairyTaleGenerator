The following variant of a well known folktale was obtained from the Rev.T. H. Philpott, of Hedge End, Botley, who learned it from his mother inWorcestershire:A hedgehog made a wager with the devil to run him a race, the hedgehog tohave the choice of time and place. He chose to run up and down a ditch atnight. When the time came the hedgehog rolled himself up at one end of theditch, and got a friend to roll himself up at the other. then he startedthe devil off. At the other end of the ditch, the friend said to thedevil, "Now we go off again." Each hedgehog kept repeating this formula athis own end of the ditch, while the devil ran up and down between them,until they ran him to death.This story would be introduced by the remark, "Now we go off again, as thehedgehog said to the devil."
