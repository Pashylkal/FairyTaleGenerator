In old times it was the habit to kill old men when they had passedfifty years. A man who was nearing his fiftieth year had a good son, whowas very sorry for his father and hid him in a wine vat, in which he caredfor him secretly.Once he bet with some of his neighbors who should seethe first rising of the sun in the morning. The merciful son told hisfather of his bet, and his father said to him, "Be careful, and when youare at the place to see the rising of the sun take, the precaution not tolook to the east as the others will do, but look instead to the west atthe highest point of the mountains, and you will win the bet."The son did as his father had advised him, and so saw first the risingof the sun. When the neighbors asked him who had advised him what to do,he said it was his father, whom he must hide and protect from a forceddeath. The people were astonished at such clever advice and concluded thatthe old men are clever and that they do not deserve to be killed, butrespected.
