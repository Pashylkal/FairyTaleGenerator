One day in the times when the sky was close to the ground a spinster wentout to pound rice. Before she began her work, she took off the beads fromaround her neck and the comb from her hair, and hung them on the sky,which at that time looked like coral rock.Then she began working, and each time that she raised her pestle into theair it struck the sky. For some time she pounded the rice, and then sheraised the pestle so high that it struck the sky very hard.Immediately the sky began to rise, and it went up so far that she lost herornaments. Never did they come down, for the comb became the moon and thebeads are the stars that are scattered about.
