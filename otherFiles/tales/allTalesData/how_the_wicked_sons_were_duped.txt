A very wealthy old man, imagining that he was on the point of death,sent for his sons and divided his property among them. However, he didnot die for several years afterwards. and miserable years many of themwere. Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bearwith much abuse and cruelty from his sons. Wretched, selfish ingrates!Previously they vied with one another in trying to please theirfather, hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had receivedtheir patrimony, they cared not how soon he left them nay, the soonerthe better, because he was only a needless trouble and expense. Andthey let the poor old man know what they felt.One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles. Thefriend sympathised very much with him, and promised to think over thematter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do. He did so.in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full ofstones and gravel before him."Look here, friend," said he. "Your sons will get to know of my cominghere to day, and will inquire about it. You must pretend that I cameto discharge a long standing debt with you, and that you are severalthousands of rupees richer than you thought you were. Keep these bagsin your own hands, and on no account let your sons get to them as longas you are alive. You will soon find them change their conduct towardsyou. Salaam. I will come again soon to see how you are getting on."When the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth theybegan to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than everbefore. And thus they continued to the day of the old man's demise,when the bags were greedily opened, and found to contain only stonesand gravel!
