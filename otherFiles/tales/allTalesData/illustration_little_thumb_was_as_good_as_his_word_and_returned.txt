THAT SAME NIGHT WITH THE NEWS" (_page_ 123))Little ThumbThere was, once upon a time, a man and his wife, faggot makers bytrade, who had seven children, all boys. The eldest was but ten yearsold, and the youngest only seven. One might wonder how that thefaggot maker could have so many children in so little a time. but itwas because his wife went nimbly about her business and never broughtfewer than two at a birth. They were very poor, and their sevenchildren incommoded them greatly, because not one of them was able toearn his bread. That which gave them yet more uneasiness was, that theyoungest was of a very puny constitution, and scarce ever spake aword, which made them take that for stupidity which was a sign of goodsense. He was very little, and, when born, no bigger than one's thumb.which made him be called Little Thumb.The poor child bore the blame of whatsoever was done amiss in thehouse, and guilty or not was always in the wrong. he was,notwithstanding, more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdomthan all his brothers put together, and if he spake little he heardand thought the more.There happened now to come a very bad year, and the famine was sogreat, that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of theirchildren. One evening, when they were all in bed and the faggot makerwas sitting with his wife at the fire, he said to her, with his heartready to burst with grief:"Thou see'st plainly that we are not able to keep our children, and Icannot see them starve to death before my face. I am resolved to losethem in the wood to morrow, which may very easily be done. for whilethey are busy in tying up the faggots, we may run away, and leavethem, without their taking any notice.""Ah!" cried out his wife, "and can'st thou thyself have the heart totake thy children out along with thee on purpose to lose them?"In vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty. shewould not consent to it. she was, indeed poor, but she was theirmother. However, having considered what a grief it would be to her tosee them perish with hunger, she at last consented and went to bed allin tears.Little Thumb heard every word that had been spoken. for observing, ashe lay in his bed, that they were talking very busily, he had got upsoftly and hid himself under his father's stool, that he might hearwhat they said, without being seen. He went to bed again, but did notsleep a wink all the rest of the night, thinking on what he ought todo. He got up early in the morning, and went to the river side, wherehe filled his pockets full of small white pebbles, and then returnedhome. They all went abroad, but Little Thumb never told his brothersone syllable of what he knew. They went into a very thick forest,where they could not see one another at ten paces distance. Thefaggot maker began to cut wood, and the children to gather up sticksto make faggots. Their father and mother seeing them busy at theirwork, got from them by degrees, and then ran away from them all atonce, along a by way, thro' the winding bushes.When the children saw they were left alone, they began to cry as loudas they could. Little Thumb let them cry on, knowing very well how togo home again. for as he came he had taken care to drop all along theway the little white pebbles he had in his pockets. Then said he tothem:"Be not afraid, brothers, father and mother have left us here, but Iwill lead you home again, only follow me." They did so, and he broughtthem home by the very same way they came into the forest. They darednot to go in, but sat themselves down at the door, listening to whattheir father and mother were saying.The very moment the faggot maker and his wife were got home, the lordof the manor sent them ten crowns, which he had owed them a longwhile, and which they never expected. This gave them new life. for thepoor people were almost famished. The faggot maker sent his wifeimmediately to the butcher's. As it was a long while since they hadeaten a bit, she bought thrice as much meat as would sup two people.Having filled their bellies, the woman said:"Alas! where are now our poor children? They would make a good feastof what we have left here. but then it was you, William, who had amind to lose them. I told you we should repent of it: what are theynow doing in the forest? Alas! dear God, the wolves have, perhaps,already eaten them up: thou art very inhuman thus to have lost thychildren."The faggot maker grew at last quite out of patience, for she repeatedthis above twenty times, that they should repent of it, and she was inthe right of it for so saying. He threatened to beat her, if she didnot hold her tongue. It was not that the faggot maker was not,perhaps, more vexed than his wife, but that she teized him, and thathe was of the humour of a great many others, who love wives who speakright, but think those very importunate who are always in the right.She was half drowned in tears, crying out:"Alas! where are now my children, my poor children?"She spake this so very loud, that the children who were at the door,began to cry out all together:"Here we are, here we are."She ran immediately to open the door, and said, hugging them:"I am glad to see you, my dear children. you are very hungry andweary. and my poor Peter, thou art horribly bemired. come in and letme clean thee."Now, you must know, that Peter was her eldest son, whom she lovedabove all the rest, because he was somewhat carrotty, as she herselfwas. They sat down to supper, and ate with such a good appetite aspleased both father and mother, whom they acquainted how frightenedthey were in the forest. speaking almost always all together. The goodfolks were extremely glad to see their children once more at home,and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted. but when the moneywas all gone, they fell again into their former uneasiness, andresolved to lose them again. and, that they might be the surer ofdoing it, to carry them at a much greater distance than before. Theycould not talk of this so secretly, but they were overheard by LittleThumb, who made account to get out of this difficulty as well as theformer. but though he got up betimes in the morning, to go and pick upsome little pebbles, he was disappointed. for he found the house doordouble locked, and was at a stand what to do. When their father hadgiven each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast, he fancied hemight make use of this bread instead of the pebbles, by throwing it inlittle bits all along the way they should pass. and so he put it upinto his pocket.Their father and mother brought them into the thickest and mostobscure part of the forest. when, stealing away into a by path, theythere left them. Little Thumb was not very uneasy at it. for hethought he could easily find the way again, by means of his breadwhich he had scattered all along as he came. But he was very muchsurprised when he could not find so much as one crumb. the birds hadcome and eaten it up every bit. They were now in great affliction, forthe farther they went, the more they were out of their way, and weremore and more bewildered in the forest.Night now came on, and there arose a terrible high wind, which madethem dreadfully afraid. They fancied they heard on every side of themthe houling of wolves coming to eat them up. they scarce dared tospeak, or turn their heads. After this, it rained very hard, which wetthem to the skin. their feet slipped at every step they took, and theyfell into the mire, whence they got up in a very dirty pickle. theirhands were in a sorry state.Little Thumb climbed up to the top of a tree, to see if he coulddiscover any thing. and having turned his head about on every side, hesaw at last a glimmering light, like that of a candle, but a long wayfrom the forest. He came down, and, when upon the ground, he could seeit no more, which grieved him sadly. However, having walked for sometime with his brothers towards that side on which he had seen thelight, he perceived it again as he came out of the wood.They came at last to the house where this candle was, not withoutabundance of fear. for very often they lost sight of it, whichhappened every time they came into a bottom. They knocked at the door,and a good woman came and open'd it. she asked them what they wished.Little Thumb told her they were poor children who had been lost in theforest, and desired to lodge there for God's sake. The woman seeingthem so very pretty, began to weep, and said to them:"Alas! poor babies, whither are ye come? Do ye know that this housebelongs to a cruel Ogre, who eats up little children?""Ah! dear Madam," answered Little Thumb (who trembled every joint ofhim, as well as his brothers) "what shall we do? To be sure, thewolves of the forest will devour us to night, if you refuse us to liehere. and so, we would rather the gentleman should eat us. Perhaps hewill take pity on us, especially if you please to beg it of him."The Ogre's wife, who believed she could conceal them from her husbandtill morning, let them come in, and brought them to warm themselves ata very good fire. for there was a whole sheep upon the spit roastingfor the Ogre's supper.As they began to be a little warm, they heard three or four great rapsat the door. this was the Ogre, who was come home. Upon this she hidthem under the bed, and went to open the door. The Ogre presentlyasked if supper was ready, and the wine drawn. and then he sat himselfdown to table. The sheep was as yet all raw and bloody. but he likedit the better for that. He sniffed about to the right and left,saying, "I smell fresh meat.""What you smell so," said his wife, "must be the calf which I havejust now killed and flayed.""I smell fresh meat, I tell thee once more," replied the Ogre, lookingcrossly at his wife, "and there is something here which I do notunderstand."As he spake these words, he got up from the table, and went directlyto the bed."Ah!" said he, "I see how thou would'st cheat me, thou cursed woman. Iknow not why I do not eat up thee too. but it is well for thee thatthou art a tough old carrion. Here is good game, which comes veryluckily to entertain three Ogres of my acquaintance, who are to pay mea visit in a day or two."With that he dragged them out from under the bed one by one. The poorchildren fell upon their knees, and begged his pardon. but they had todo with one of the most cruel Ogres in the world, who, far from havingany pity on them, had already devoured them with his eyes. he told hiswife they would be delicate eating, when tossed up with good savourysauce. He then took a great knife, and coming up to these poorchildren, whetted it upon a great whet stone which he held in his lefthand. He had already taken hold of one of them, when his wife said tohim:"What need you do it now? It is time enough to morrow?""Hold your prattling," said the Ogre, "they will eat the tenderer.""But you have so much meat already," replied his wife, "you have nooccasion. Here is a calf, two sheep, and half a hog.""That is true," said the Ogre, "give them their belly full, that theymay not fall away, and put them to bed."The good woman was overjoyed at this, and gave them a good supper. butthey were so much afraid, they could not eat a bit. As for the Ogre,he sat down again to drink, being highly pleased that he had gotwherewithal to treat his friends. He drank a dozen glasses more thanordinary, which got up into his head, and obliged him to go to bed.The Ogre had seven daughters, all little children, and these youngOgresses had all of them very fine complexions, because they used toeat fresh meat like their father. but they had little grey eyes, quiteround, hooked noses, wide mouths, and very long sharp teeth standingat a good distance from each other. They were not as yet over andabove mischievous. but they promised very fair for it, for theyalready bit little children, that they might suck their blood. Theyhad been put to bed early, with every one a crown of gold upon herhead. There was in the same chamber another bed of the like bigness,and it was into this bed the Ogre's wife put the seven little boys.after which she went to bed to her husband.Little Thumb, who had observed that the Ogre's daughters had crowns ofgold upon their heads, and was afraid lest the Ogre should repent hisnot killing them, got up about midnight. and taking his brothers'bonnets and his own, went very softly, put them upon the heads of theseven little Ogresses, after having taken off their crowns of gold,which he put upon his own head and his brothers', that the Ogre mighttake them for his daughters, and his daughters for the little boyswhom he wanted to kill. All this succeeded according to his desire.for the Ogre waking about midnight, and sorry that he deferred to dothat till morning which he might have done over night, threw himselfhastily out of bed, and taking his great knife:"Let us see," said he, "how our little rogues do, and not make twojobs of the matter."He then went up, groping all the way, into his daughters' chamber. andcame to the bed where the little boys lay, who were every soul of themfast asleep. except Little Thumb, who was terribly afraid when hefound the Ogre fumbling about his head, as he had done about hisbrothers'. The Ogre, feeling the golden crowns, said:"I should have made a fine piece of work of it truly. I find I guzzledtoo much last night."Then he went to the bed where the girls lay. and having found theboys' little bonnets: "Hah!" said he, "my merry lads, are you there?Let us to work!"And saying these words, without more ado, he cut the throats of allhis seven daughters.Well pleased with what he had done, he went to bed again to his wife.So soon as Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore, he waked his brothers,and bade them put on their clothes presently, and follow him. Theystole down softly into the garden, and got over the wall. They keptrunning almost all night, trembling all the while, without knowingwhich way they went.The Ogre, when he waked, said to his wife:"Go up stairs and dress those young rascals who came here last night."The Ogress was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband,not dreaming after what manner he intended she should dress them. butthinking that he had ordered her to go and put on their cloaths, wentup, and was strangely astonished when she perceived her sevendaughters killed, and weltering in their blood. She fainted away. forthis is the first expedient almost all women find in such like cases.The Ogre, fearing his wife would be too long in doing what he hadordered, went up himself to help her. He was no less amazed than hiswife, at this frightful spectacle."Ah! what have I done?" cried he. "The cursed wretches shall pay forit, and that instantly."He threw then a pitcher of water upon his wife's face. and havingbrought her to herself:"Give me quickly," cried he, "my boots of seven leagues, that I may goand catch them."He went out. and, having run over a vast deal of ground, both on thisside and that, he came at last into the very road where the poorchildren were, and not above a hundred paces from their father'shouse. They espied the Ogre, who went at one step from mountain tomountain, and over rivers as easily as the narrowest kennels.Little Thumb, seeing a hollow rock near the place where they were,made his brothers hide themselves in it, and crowded into it himself,minding always what would become of the Ogre.The Ogre, who found himself much tired with his long and fruitlessjourney (for these boots of seven leagues extremely fatigue thewearer), had a great mind to rest himself, and, by chance, went tosit down upon the rock where these little boys had hid themselves. Ashe was worn out, he fell asleep: and, after reposing himself some timehe began to snore so frightfully, that the poor children were no lessafraid of him, than when he held up his great knife, and was going tocut their throats. Little Thumb was not so much frightened as hisbrothers, and told them that they should run away immediately towardshome, while the Ogre was asleep so soundly. and that they should notbe anxious about him. They took his advice, and got home presently.Little Thumb came up to the Ogre, pulled off his boots gently, and putthem on upon his own legs. The boots were very long and large. but asthey were Fairies, they had the gift of becoming big and little,according to the legs of those who wore them. so that they fitted hisfeet and legs as well as if they had been made on purpose for him.He went immediately to the Ogre's house, where he saw his wife cryingbitterly for the loss of her murdered daughters."Your husband," said Little Thumb, "is in very great danger, beingtaken by a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him, if he does notgive them all his gold and silver. Just when they held their daggersat his throat, he perceived me, and desired me to come and tell youthe condition he is in, and that you should give me whatsoever he hasof value, without retaining any one thing. for otherwise they willkill him without mercy. and, as his case is very pressing, he desiredme to make use (you see I have them on) of his boots, that I mightmake the more haste, and to shew you that I do not impose upon you."The good woman, being sadly frightened, gave him all she had: for thisOgre was a very good husband, tho' he used to eat up little children.Little Thumb, having thus got all the Ogre's money, came home to hisfather's house, where he was received with abundance of joy.There are many people who do not agree in this circumstance, andpretend that Little Thumb never robbed the Ogre at all, and that heonly thought he might very justly, and with safe conscience take offhis boots of seven leagues, because he made no other use of them, butto run after little children. These folks affirm, that they were verywell assured of this, and the more, as having drank and eaten often atthe faggot maker's house. They aver, that, when Little Thumb had takenoff the Ogre's boots, he went to Court, where he was informed thatthey were very anxious about a certain army, which was two hundredleagues off, and the success of a battle. He went, say they, to theKing, and told him that, if he desired it, he would bring him newsfrom the army before night. The King promised him a great sum of moneyupon that condition. Little Thumb was as good as his word, andreturned that very same night with the news. and this first expeditioncausing him to be known, he got whatever he pleased. for the King paidhim very well for carrying his orders to the army, and abundance ofladies gave him what he would to bring them news from their lovers.and that this was his greatest gain. There were some married women,too, who sent letters by him to their husbands, but they paid him soill that it was not worth his while, and turned to such small account,that he scorned ever to reckon what he got that way. After having, forsome time, carried on the business of a messenger, and gained therebygreat wealth, he went home to his father, where it was impossible toexpress the joy they were all in at his return. He made the wholefamily very well to do, bought places for his father and brothers. andby that means settled them very handsomely in the world, and, in themean time, rose high in the King's favour.
