In the beginning there were four beings (Melu, Fiuweigh, Diwata, andSaweigh), and they lived on an island no larger than a hat. On this islandthere were no trees or grass or any other living thing besides these fourpeople and one bird (Buswit). One day they sent this bird out across thewaters to see what he could find, and when he returned he brought someearth, a piece of rattan, and some fruit.Melu, the greatest of the four, took the soil and shaped it and beat itwith a paddle in the same manner in which a woman shapes pots of clay, andwhen he finished he had made the earth. Then he planted the seeds from thefruit, and they grew until there was much rattan and many trees bearingfruit.The four beings watched the growth for a long time and were well pleasedwith the work, but finally Melu said, "Of what use is this earth and allthe rattan and fruit if there are no people?"And the others replied, "Let us make some people out of wax."So they took some wax and worked long, fashioning it into forms, but whenthey brought them to the fire the wax melted, and they saw that men couldnot be made in that way.Next they decided to try to use dirt in making people, and Melu and one ofhis companions began working on that. All went well till they were readyto make the noses. The companion, who was working on that part, put themon upside down. Melu told him that the people would drown if he left themthat way, but he refused to change them.When his back was turned, however, Melu seized the noses, one by one, andturned them as they now are. But he was in such a hurry that he pressedhis finger at the root, and it left a mark in the soft clay which you canstill see on the faces of people.
