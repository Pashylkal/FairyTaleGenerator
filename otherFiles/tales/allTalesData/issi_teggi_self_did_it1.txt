The Estonians call a farm servant who is in charge of barns and grain arow man . Such a row man was once sitting and molding buttonswhen the devil came up to him, greeted him, and asked, "What are you doingthere?""I am molding eyes.""Eyes? Can you mold me some new ones?""Oh yes, but right now I do not have any at hand.""But would you do it for me another time?""I can do that," said the row man ."When should I come back?""Whenever you want to."The next day the devil returned to have eyes molded for himself.The row man said, "Do you want large ones or small ones?""Very large ones."The man began to melt a large quantity of lead, saying, "I cannot mold foryou unless you let me tie you down."He told him to lie down with his back on a bench, then took some thick,strong cords and tied him down securely.After the devil was tightly bound, he asked, "What is your name?""My name is Issi (self).""That is a good name. I do not know of a better one."The lead was now molten. The devil opened his eyes wide, thinking to getnew ones, and waiting for the cast."I'm pouring now," said the row man , then poured the hot lead intothe devil's eyes.The devil jumped up, with the bench on his back, and ran away. He ran pastsome people who were plowing in a field. They asked, "Who did that toyou?"The devil answered, " Issi teggi (self did it)."The people laughed and said, "Self done, self have."The devil died of his new eyes, and since then no one has ever seen himagain.
