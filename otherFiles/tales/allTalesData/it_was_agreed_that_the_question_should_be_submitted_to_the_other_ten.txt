sisters. All were on the side of the eldest. Then the youngest sisterdeclared that if they laid a finger on the little garden boy, she wouldherself go and tell their father the secret of the holes in their shoes.At last it was decided that Michael should be put to the test. that theywould take him to the ball, and at the end of supper would give him thephiltre which was to enchant him like the rest.They sent for the Star Gazer, and asked him how he had contrived tolearn their secret. but still he remained silent.Then, in commanding tones, the eldest sister gave him the order they hadagreed upon.He only answered:'I will obey.'He had really been present, invisible, at the council of princesses, andhad heard all. but he had made up his mind to drink of the philtre, andsacrifice himself to the happiness of her he loved.Not wishing, however, to cut a poor figure at the ball by the side ofthe other dancers, he went at once to the laurels, and said:'My lovely rose laurel, with the golden rake I have raked thee, withthe golden bucket I have watered thee, with a silken towel I have driedthee. Dress me like a prince.'A beautiful pink flower appeared. Michael gathered it, and found himselfin a moment clothed in velvet, which was as black as the eyes of thelittle Princess, with a cap to match, a diamond aigrette, and a blossomof the rose laurel in his button hole.Thus dressed, he presented himself that evening before the Duke ofBeloeil, and obtained leave to try and discover his daughters' secret.He looked so distinguished that hardly anyone would have known who hewas.
