Regarding the building of this (Kilgrim) bridge is the followingcurious legend:Many bridges having been built on this site by the inhabitants, nonehad been able to withstand the fury of the floods until his "SatanicMajesty" promised to build a bridge which would defy the fury of theelements, on condition that the first living creature who passed overshould fall a sacrifice to his "Sable Majesty."Long did the inhabitants consider, when the bridge was complete, as towho should be the victim. A shepherd, more wise than his neighbors, owneda dog called Grim. This man having first swum the river, whistled for thedog to follow. Poor Grim unwittingly bounded across the bridge and thusfell a victim to his "Sable Majesty."Tradition says, from this circumstance the spot has ever since beenknown as Kill Grim Bridge.
