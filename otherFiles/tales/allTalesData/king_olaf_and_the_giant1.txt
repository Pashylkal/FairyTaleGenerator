King Olaf of Norway, engrossed in thought, wandered between mountain andvalley. He wanted to build a church whose equal could not be found farand wide, but he realized that he could not do so without severely taxinghis kingdom. While sadly pondering this problem he met a man of curiousappearance, who asked him why he was so contemplative. Olaf revealed theproblem to him, and the giant (or troll) offered to accomplish the taskfor him within a certain time. His reward would be the sun and the moonor Saint Olaf himself.Olaf entered into this agreement, but then drew up plans that he thoughtwould be impossible to execute. The church was to be so large that sevenpriests would be able to preach in it at one time without disturbing oneanother. The pillars and decorations, both inside and out, were to be ofhard flint, and so forth.Soon such a church was standing there, complete except for roof andsteeple. Deeply concerned, Olaf again wandered through the mountains andvalleys. Suddenly, from within a mountain, he a child crying and agiantess comforting it with the words:Shush, shush,tomorrow your father,Wind and Weather,will come home,and he will bring youthe sun and the moonor Saint Olaf himself!Olaf returned home, elated with this discovery (for one can destroy anevil spirit's power with his name). Everything was finished. Thesteeple had just been set into place. Then Olaf called out:Vind och Veder!du har satt spiran sneder!(Wind and Weather,you have set the steeple on crooked!)The giant fell from the top of the church with a horrible crash, andburst into many pieces of flintstone.
