In the vicinity of the main road between Neubrandenburg andStavenhagen, adjacent to the field belonging to Gevezin and Blankenhof,there are three hills: Blocksberg, Jabsberg, and Lindberg.A long time ago lindorms lived there. When they lay outstretched, theyresembled a felled fir tree, and they were feared far and wide.Once a wagon was driving along the road, and not far from the watermill itcame to a young lindorm lying across the road asleep in the sun. Thinkingthat it was a fir log, the driver drove over it. Only after the run overbeast cried out did the driver realize what it was, and he drove away.Hearing the cry, the old lindorm rushed forward and found its young onedead. Enraged, it attacked a wagon loaded with straw headed in thedirection of Neubrandenburg. The driver saw it and fled in a gallop.Fortunately, on the far side of the Neuendorf Enclosure he lost hisconnecting pin, leaving the rear part of the wagon behind with its load ofstraw, while the driver hurried away all the faster on the front part ofthe wagon.The lindorm tore about in the straw, but finding no one there, itcontinued in pursuit of the driver. In order to gain speed, it bit intoits tail, then rolled along after the wagon like a hoop. The driver justbarely made it to the Brandenburg gate, which was quickly closed behindhim, with the lindorm on the outside.The lindorm remained lying just outside the gate, there where SaintGeorge's Church now stands, and no one from Brandenburg dared to gothrough the gate.Now a foreign prince by the name of George was in the city, and he madethe decision to challenge the lindorm. After a difficult battle hesucceeded in cutting off the beast's tail, which was the source of itsstrength, and then he quickly killed it.In commemoration of this event Saint George's Church was built, and thestory is depicted on its altar.
