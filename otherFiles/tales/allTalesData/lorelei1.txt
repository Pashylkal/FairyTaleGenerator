Her beauty was her undoing. Lorelei was not willfully seductive, but mencould not resist her charms, and she could not resist their advances.She was bringing scandal and disgrace to the respectable town ofBacharach on the Rhine.There was even talk that she must be a witch or a woman possessed of thedevil. The bishop, however, would not hear of an execution without dueprocess, and he summoned her to his court. His questions were at firststern and severe. Her answers were simple and sincere. The bishop'sseverity, his piety, and his priesthood, however, did not prevail, and inthe end he pronounced her free of all guilt."I cannot continue like this!" she cried. "My eyes are the destructionof every man who looks into them. I have loved only one man, and heabandoned me and left for a distant land. Please let me die!"But the good bishop could not bring himself to pronounce a deathsentence. Instead, he proposed that she dedicate herself to God, andcalled three knights to accompany her to the convent. Arrangements weremade forthwith, and the three knights were soon underway with theirbeautiful ward.When their path led them past a high cliff overlooking the Rhine, Loreleihad one last request of her escorts. "Please," she said, "let me climbthe cliff and have one last look into the Rhine." Unable to deny herthis wish, the three knights tethered their horses, and the four of themclimbed to the top of the cliff.Standing at the edge of the precipice, Lorelei said, "See that boat onthe Rhine. The boatman is my lover!" And with no further warning, shejumped from the cliff into the Rhine.The three knights also met their death there, without a priest andwithout a grave.Who is the singer of this song?A boatman on the Rhine,And we always hear the echoOf the Three Knight Stone:LoreleiLoreleiLoreleiAs though there were three of us.
