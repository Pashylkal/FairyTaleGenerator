Stories of fairies appearing in the shape of cats are common in theNorth of England. Mr. Longstaffe relates that a farmer of Staindrop, inDurham, was one night crossing a bridge, when a cat jumped out, stoodbefore him, and looking him full in the face, said:Johnny Reed! Johnny Reed!Tell Madam MomfortThat Mally Dixon's dead.The farmer returned home, and in mickle wonder recited this awfu'stanza to his wife, when up started their black cat, saying, "Is she?" anddisappeared for ever. It was supposed she was a fairy in disguise, whothus went to attend a sister's funeral, for in the North fairies do die,and green shady spots are pointed out by the country folks as thecemeteries of the tiny people.
