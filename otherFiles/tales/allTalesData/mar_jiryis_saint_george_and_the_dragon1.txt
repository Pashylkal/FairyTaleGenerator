There was once a great city that depended for its water supply upon afountain without the walls. A great dragon, possessed and moved by Satanhimself, took possession of the fountain and refused to allow water to betaken unless, whenever people came to the spring, a youth or maiden wasgiven to him to devour. The people tried again and again to destroy themonster. but though the flower of the city cheerfully went forth againstit, its breath was so pestilential that they used to drop down dead beforethey came within bow shot.The terrorized inhabitants were thus obliged to sacrifice theiroffspring, or die of thirst. till at last all the youth of the place hadperished except the king's daughter. So great was the distress of theirsubjects for want of water that her heart broken parents could no longerwithhold her, and amid the tears of the populace she went out towards thespring, where the dragon lay awaiting her. But just as the noisome monsterwas going to leap on her, Mar Jiryis appeared, in golden panoply, upon afine white steed, and spear in hand. Riding full tilt at the dragon, hestruck it fair between the eyes and laid it dead. The king, out ofgratitude for this unlooked for succor, gave Mar Jiryis his daughter andhalf of his kingdom.
