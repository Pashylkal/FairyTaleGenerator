One of Arthur's warriors, whose name was March (or Parch) Amheirchion,was lord of Castellmarch in Lleyn. This man had horse's ears (resemblingMidas), and lest anybody should know it, he used to kill every man hesought to shave his beard, for fear lest he should not be able to keep thesecret. and on the spot where he was wont to bury the bodies there grewreeds, one of which somebody cut to make a pipe.The pipe would give no other sound than "March Amheirchion has horse'sears."When the warrior heard this, he would probably have killed the innocentman on that account, if he had not himself failed to make the pipe produceany other sound. But after hearing where the reed had grown, he made nofurther effort to conceal either the murders or his ears.
