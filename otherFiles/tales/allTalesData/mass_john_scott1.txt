A Mass John Scott, minister of Peebles, is reported to have been the lastrenowned exorciser, and to have lost his life in a contest with anobstinate spirit. This was owing to the conceited rashness of a youngclergyman, who commenced the ceremony of laying the ghost before thearrival of Mass John. It is the nature, it seems, of spirits disembodied,as well as embodied, to increase in strength and presumption, inproportion to the advantages which they may gain over the opponent. Theyoung clergyman losing courage, the horrors of the scene were increased tosuch a degree, that, as Mass John approached the house in which it passed,he beheld the slates and tiles flying from the roof, as if dispersed witha whirlwind. At his entry, be perceived all the wax tapers (the mostessential instruments or conjuration) extinguished, except one, whichalready burned blue in the socket. The arrival of the experienced sagechanged the scene: he brought the spirit to reason. but unfortunately,while addressing a word or advice or censure to his rash brother, hepermitted the ghost to obtain the last word, a circumstance which, in allcolloquies of this nature, is strictly to be guarded against. This fataloversight occasioned his falling into a lingering disorder, of which benever recovered.
