A midwife in Westerhausen was sitting one evening at home when someoneknocked on her window and shouted that she should come outside. She didso, and there stood a nix, who told her to follow him. They walked to theBeck (a deep pond near Westerhausen), and the nix took a rod and struckthe water with it. The water separated, and with dry feet they walked tothe bottom.Here the woman helped the nix's wife deliver a child. To thank themidwife, the nixie told her that when the nix asked her how she should bepaid, instead of money, she should ask for some of the sweepings.Then the midwife bathed the new baby, and while doing so she heard thenix's other children   there were five of them   running around andasking their father, "Shall we pinch her? Shall we pinch her?" But thefather told them not to.When the midwife was finished the nix asked, "What shall I pay you?"Following the wife's advice, she requested some of the sweepings frombehind the door."God told you to say that," said the nix, giving her what she wanted. Thenhe took her back home, and when she looked at the sweepings, they hadturned to pure gold.
