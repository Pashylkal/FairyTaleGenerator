_Mor of Cloyne, a Munster Princess, is singing at the door of a FairyRath to her sister, a captive within it, the magic tune by which sheonce escaped from a like captivity._Little Sister, whom the FayHides away within his doon,Deep below yon seeding fern,Oh, list and learn my magic tune.Long ago, when snared like theeBy the Shee, my harp and IO'er them wove the slumber spell,Warbling well its lullaby.Till with dreamy smiles they sank,Rank on rank, before the strain.And I rose from out the rath,And found my path to earth again.Little Sister, to my woeHid below among the Shee,List and learn the magic tune,That it full soon may succour thee.ALFRED PERCEVAL GRAVES.
