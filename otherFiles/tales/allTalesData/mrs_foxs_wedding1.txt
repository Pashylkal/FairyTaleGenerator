He stretched himself out beneath the bench, did not move a limb, andpretended to be stone dead.Mrs. Fox locked herself in her room, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat on thehearth and cooked.As soon as it became known that the old fox had died, suitors began toappear. The maid heard someone knocking at the front door. She opened it,and there stood a young fox, who said:What are you doing, Miss Cat?Are you asleep, or are you awake?She answered:I'm not asleep. I am awake.Do you want to know what I am doing?I am cooking warm beer with butter in it.Would you like to be my guest?"No thank you, Miss," said the fox. "What is Mrs. Fox doing?"The maid answered:She is sitting in her roomMourning and grieving.She has cried her eyes red,Because old Mr. Fox is dead."Miss, tell her that a young fox is here who would like to courther.""I'll do that, young man."The cat went upstairs and knocked on the door."Mrs. Fox, are you there?""Yes, my dear, yes.""A suitor is outside.""What does he look like? Does he have nine bushy tails like the lateMr. Fox?""No," answered the cat. "He has but one.""Then I'll not have him."Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the suitor away.Soon afterward there was another knock at the door. Another fox wasthere who wanted to court Mrs. Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fareany better than the first one. Then others came, each with one additionaltail, but all were turned away until finally one came who had nine tails,just like old Mr. Fox.
