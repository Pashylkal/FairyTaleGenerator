A widow and her son, a little boy, lived together in a cottage in or nearthe village of Rothley, Northumberland. One winter evening, the childrefused to go to bed with his mother, as he wished to sit up for a whilelonger, "for," said he "I am not sleepy."The mother, finding remonstrance in vain, at last told him that if he satup by himself, the fairies would most certainly come and take him away.The boy laughed as his mother went to bed, leaving him sitting by thefire.He had not been there long, watching the fire and enjoying its cheerfulwarmth, till a beautiful little figure, about the size of a child's doll,descended the chimney, and alighted on the hearth! The little fellow wassomewhat startled at first, but its prepossessing smile as it paced to andfro before him, soon overcame his fears, and he enquired familiarly "Whatdo they ca' thou?""Ainsel" answered the little thing haughtily, at the same time retortingthe question, "And what do they ca' thou? "" My Ainsel," answered the boy. and they commenced playing togetherlike two children newly acquainted. Their gambols continued quiteinnocently until the fire began to grow dim. the boy then took up thepoker to stir it, when a hot cinder accidentally fell upon the foot of hisplaymate, her tiny voice was instantly raised to a most terrific roar, andthe boy had scarcely time to crouch into the bed behind his mother, beforethe voice of the old fairy mother was heard shouting "Who's done it? Who'sdone it?""Oh! It was My Ainsel!" answered the daughter."Why then," said the mother, as she kicked her up the chimney, "What's allthe noise for, there's nyen (no one) to blame."
