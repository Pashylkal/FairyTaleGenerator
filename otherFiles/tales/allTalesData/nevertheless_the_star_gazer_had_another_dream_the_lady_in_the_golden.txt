She thusaddressed him:'Plant these two laurels in two large pots, rake them over with therake, water them with the bucket, and wipe them with the towel. Whenthey have grown as tall as a girl of fifteen, say to each of them, ''Mybeautiful laurel, with the golden rake I have raked you, with the goldenbucket I have watered you, with the silken towel I have wiped you.''Then after that ask anything you choose, and the laurels will give it toyou.'Michael thanked the lady in the golden dress, and when he woke he foundthe two laurel bushes beside him. So he carefully obeyed the orders hehad been given by the lady.The trees grew very fast, and when they were as tall as a girl offifteen he said to the cherry laurel, 'My lovely cherry laurel, withthe golden rake I have raked thee, with the golden bucket I have wateredthee, with the silken towel I have wiped thee. Teach me how to becomeinvisible.' Then there instantly appeared on the laurel a pretty whiteflower, which Michael gathered and stuck into his button hole.
