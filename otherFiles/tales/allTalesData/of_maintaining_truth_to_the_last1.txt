In the reign of Gordian, there was a certain noble soldier who hada fair but vicious wife. It happened that her husband having occasion totravel, the lady sent for her gallant. Now, one of her handmaids, itseems, was skillful in interpreting the song of birds. and in the court ofthe castle there were three cocks. During the night, while the gallant waswith his mistress, the first cock began to crow.The lady heard it, and said to her servant, "Dear friend, what saysyonder cock?"She replied, "That you are grossly injuring your husband.""Then," said the lady, "kill that cock without delay."They did so. But soon after, the second cock crew, and the ladyrepeated her question."Madam," said the handmaid, "he says, 'My companion died for revealingthe truth, and for the same cause, I am prepared to die.'""Kill him," cried the lady, which they did.After this, the third cock crew."What says he?" asked she again."Hear, see, and say nothing, if you would live in peace.""Oh, oh!" said the lady. " Don't kill him." And her orders wereobeyed.ApplicationMy beloved, the emperor is God. the soldier, Christ. and thewife, the soul. The gallant is the devil. The handmaid is conscience. Thefirst cock is our Savior, who was put to death. the second is the martyrs.and the third is a preacher who ought to be earnest in declaring thetruth, but, being deterred by menaces, is afraid to utter it.
