Asse to the Towne to SylleAn olde man on a tyme, and a lyttell boye his sonne droue a litel assebefore them, whiche he purposed to sylle at the markette towne that theywent to. And bicause he so dyd, the folkes that wrought by the way syde,blamed hym. wherfore he set vp his sonne, and went hym selfe on fote.Other that sawe that, called hym foole, by cause he lette the yonge boyeryde, and he beynge so aged to goo a foote. Than he toke downe the boye,and lepte vp, and rode hym selfe. whanne he hadde rydden a lyttell waye,he harde other that blamed hym, bycause he made the lyttell yonge boyeronne after as a seruaunte, and he his father to ryde. Than he sette vppethe boye behynde hym, and so rode forthe.Anone he mette with other, that asked hym if the asse were his owne: Bywhiche wordes he coniected, that he did nat wel so to ouercharge thelyttell sely asse, that vnethe was able to b'eare one. Thus he troubledwith their dyuers and manyfolde opinions: whiche neither with his assevacant, nor he alone, nor his sonne alone, nor bothe to gether rydyng atones on the asse, coulde passe forth with out detraction and blame:wherfore at last he bounde the asse feet to gether, and put through astaffe, and so he and his sonne began to beare the asse betwene them ontheir shulders to the towne. The nouelte of whiche syght caused euery bodyto laughe and blame the folysshenes of them both. The sely olde man was sosore agreued, that as he sat and rested hym on a ryuers syde, he threwehis asse in to the water. And so whan he had drowned his asse, he tournedhome agayne. Thus the good man desyrynge to please euerye bodye,contentynge none at all, loste his asse.By this tale appereth playnelye, that they whiqhe commyt them selfe to theopinion of the common people, ben oppressed with great myserye andseruage: For how is it possible to please all, whan euery man hath adyuers opinion, and dyuerslye iudgeth? And that was well knowen to thepoet, whan he sayde,Scinditur incertum studia in contraria vulgus.And as Cicero, Persius, and Flaccus say: As many men so many myndes: asmany heedes so many wyttes. That, that pleaseth one, displeaseth an other:Fewe alowe that that they loue nat: and that that a man aloweth, hethynketh good. Therfore the beste is, that euery man lyue well, as a goodChristen man shulde, and care nat for the vayne wordes, and ianglynge ofthe people. For bablynge (as Plutarchus sayth) is a greuous disease, andhard to be remedied. For that that shulde heale it (which is wordes ofwisdome) cureth them that harkneth there vnto: but pratlers wille herenone but them selfe.
