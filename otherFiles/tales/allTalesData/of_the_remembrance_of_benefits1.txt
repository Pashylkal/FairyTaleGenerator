There was a knight who devoted much of his time to hunting. Ithappened one day, as he was pursuing this diversion, that he was met by alame lion, who showed him his foot. The knight dismounted, and drew fromit a sharp thorn. and then applied an unguent to the wound, which speedilyhealed it.A while after this, the king of the country hunted in the same wood,and caught that lion, and held him captive for many years.Now, the knight, having offended the king, fled from his anger to thevery forest in which he had been accustomed to hunt. There he betookhimself to plunder, and spoiled and slew a multitude of travelers. But theking's sufferance was exhausted. he sent out an army, captured, andcondemned him to be delivered to a fasting lion. The knight wasaccordingly thrown into a pit, and remained in terrified expectation ofthe hour when he should be devoured. But the lion, considering himattentively, and remembering his former friend, fawned upon him. andremained seven days with him destitute of food.When this reached the ears of the king, he was struck with wonder, anddirected the knight to be taken from the pit. "Friend," said he, "by whatmeans have you been able to render the lion harmless?""As I once rode along the forest, my lord, that lion met me lame. Iextracted from his foot a large thorn, and afterward healed the wound, andtherefore he has spared me.""Well," returned the king, "since the lion has spared you, I will forthis time ratify your pardon. Study to amend your life."The knight gave thanks to the king, and ever afterwards conductedhimself with all propriety. He lived to a good old age, and ended his daysin peace.Application:My beloved, the knight is the world. the lame lion is the human race.the thorn, original sin, drawn out by baptism. The pit representspenitence, whence safety is derived.
