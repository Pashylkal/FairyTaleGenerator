A certain knight had three sons, and on his deathbed he bequeathed theinheritance to his firstborn. to the second, his treasury. and to thethird, a very valuable ring, of more worth indeed than all he had left tothe others.But the two former had also rings, and they were all apparently thesame.After their father's death the first son said, "I possess that preciousring of my father."The second said, "You have it not   I have."To this the third son answered, "That is not true. The elder of us hasthe estate, the second the treasure, and therefore it is but meet that Ishould have the most valuable ring."The first son answered, "Let us prove, then, whose claims to it havethe preeminence."They agreed, and several sick men were made to resort to them for thepurpose. The two first rings had no effect, but the last cured all theirinfirmities.Application:My beloved, the knight is Christ. The three sons are the Jews, Saracens(Muslims), and Christians. The most valuable ring is faith, which is theproperty of the younger, that is, of the Christians
