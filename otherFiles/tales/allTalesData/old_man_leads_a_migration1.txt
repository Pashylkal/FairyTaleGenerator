The first Indians were on the other side of the ocean, and Old Mandecided to lead them to a better place. So he brought them over the ice tothe far north. When they were crossing the ice, the Sarcee were in themiddle and there was a boy riding on a dog travois. As they were goingalong, this boy saw a horn of some animal sticking up through the ice. Nowthe boy wanted this horn, and began to cry. So his mother took an ax andcut it off. As she did so, the ice gave way, and only those on this sideof the place where the horn was will ever get here.Now Old Man led these people down to where the Blood Reserve now is,and told them that this would be a fine country for them, and that theywould be very rich.He said, "I will get all the people here."All the people living there ate and lived like wild animals. but OldMan went among them and taught them all the arts of civilization. (Whencrossing the ice, only about thirty lodges succeeded in getting across,and among these were the representatives of all the tribes now in thiscountry. At that time the Blackfoot were just one tribe.)When he was through teaching them, he did not die, but went among theSioux, where he remained for a time, but finally disappeared . He took hiswife with him. He had no children.
