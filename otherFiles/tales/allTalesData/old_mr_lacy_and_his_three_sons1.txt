They have a tradition at Winterton that there was formerly one Mr.Lacy, that lived there and was a very rich man, who, being grown veryaged, gave all that he had away unto his three sons, upon condition thatone should keep him one week, and another another.But it happened within a little while that they were all weary of him,after that they had got what they had, and regarded him no more than adog.The old man perceiving how he was slighted, went to an attorney to seeif his skill could not afford him any help in his troubles. The attorneytold him that no law in the land could help him nor yield him any comfort,but there was one thing only which would certainly do, which, if he wouldperform, he would reveal to him. At this the poor old man was exceedingglad, and desired him for God's sake to reveal the same, for he was almostpined and starved to death, and he would willingly do it rather than liveas he did."Well," says the lawyer, "you have been a great friend of mine in myneed, and I will now be one to you in your need. I will lend you astrongbox with a strong lock on it, in which shall be contained 1000pounds. You shall on such a day pretend to have fetched it out of acloset, where it shall be supposed that you had hidden it, and carry itinto one of your son's houses, and make it your business every week, whileyou are sojourning with such or such a son, to be always counting of themoney, and rattling it about, and you shall see that, for love of it,they'll soon love you again, and make very much of you, and maintain youjoyfully, willingly, and plentifully, unto your dying day."The old man, having thanked the lawyer for this good advice and kindproffer, received within a few days the aforesaid box full of money, andhaving so managed it as above, his graceless sons soon fell in love withhim again, and made mighty much of him, and perceiving that their love tohim continued steadfast and firm, he one day took it out of the house andcarried it to the lawyer, thanking him exceedingly for the loan thereof.But when he got to his sons he made them believe that he had hidden itagain, and that he would give it to him of them whom he loved best when hedied. This made them all so observant of him that he lived the rest of hisdays in great peace, plenty, and happiness amongst them, and died full ofyears.But a while before he died, he upbraided them for their formeringratitude, told them the whole history of the box, and forgave them.
