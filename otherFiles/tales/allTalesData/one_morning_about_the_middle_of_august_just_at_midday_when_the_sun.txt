was hottest, Michael ate his dinner of a piece of dry bread, and wentto sleep under an oak. And while he slept he dreamt that there appearedbefore him a beautiful lady, dressed in a robe of cloth of gold, whosaid to him: 'Go to the castle of Beloeil, and there you shall marry aprincess.'That evening the little cow boy, who had been thinking a great dealabout the advice of the lady in the golden dress, told his dream to thefarm people. But, as was natural, they only laughed at the Star Gazer.The next day at the same hour he went to sleep again under the sametree. The lady appeared to him a second time, and said: 'Go to thecastle of Beloeil, and you shall marry a princess.'In the evening Michael told his friends that he had dreamed the samedream again, but they only laughed at him more than before. 'Nevermind,' he thought to himself. 'if the lady appears to me a third time, Iwill do as she tells me.'The following day, to the great astonishment of all the village, abouttwo o'clock in the afternoon a voice was heard singing:'Raleo, raleo, How the cattle go!'It was the little cow boy driving his herd back to the byre.The farmer began to scold him furiously, but he answered quietly, 'I amgoing away,' made his clothes into a bundle, said good bye to all hisfriends, and boldly set out to seek his fortunes.There was great excitement through all the village, and on the top ofthe hill the people stood holding their sides with laughing, as theywatched the Star Gazer trudging bravely along the valley with his bundleat the end of his stick.It was enough to make anyone laugh, certainly.
