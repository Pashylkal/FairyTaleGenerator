One night the Hodja looked into his well and saw there the reflectionof the full moon."Oh no!" he exclaimed. "The moon has fallen from the sky and into mywell!"He ran into his house and returned with a hook attached to a rope. Hethen threw the hook into the water and commenced to pull it up again, butit became stuck on the side of the well. Frantically the Hodja tugged andpulled with all his might. The hook suddenly came loose, and the Hodjafell over backwards, landing flat on his back. Scarcely able to move, helooked up into the sky and saw the full moon above him."I may have injured myself in doing so," he said with satisfaction,"but at least I got the moon back into the sky where it belongs."
