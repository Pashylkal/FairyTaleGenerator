Thus people's minds becameexcited and they fell into a panic. As a result, in the last two daysseveral innocent people have been savagely assulted by excited crowds indifferent parts of the town, having come under suspicion for perfectlyinnocent actions. Thus, one man seen carrying his own child on amotorcycle was stopped and assulted. A person appears to have been beatento death.The Commissioner of Police has taken all possible steps to restoreconfidence, and the Coproration has been invited to assist. It is hopedthat all members of the public will help in allaying this foolish panicwhich has already had such tragic consequences.
