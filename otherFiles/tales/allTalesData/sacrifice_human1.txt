Castles remarkable for size, strength, and antiquity are, by the commonpeople, commonly attributed to the Picts, or Pechs, who are not supposedto have trusted solely to their skill in masonry in constructing theseedifices, but are believed to have bathed the foundation stone with humanblood, in order to propitiate the spirit of the soil. Similar to this isthe Gaelic tradition, according to which St. Columba is supposed to havebeen forced to bury St. Oran alive beneath the foundation of hismonastery, in order to propitiate the spirits of the soil, who demolishedby night what was built during the day.
