Once upon a time there was a girl called Saddaedda, who was crazy. Oneday, when her mother had gone into the country and she was left alone inthe house, she went into a church where the funeral service was being readover the body of a rich lady. The girl hid herself in the confessional. Noone knew she was there. So, when the other people had gone, she was leftalone with the corpse. It was dressed out in a rose colored robe andeverything else becoming, and it had earrings in its ears and rings on itsfingers. These the girl took off, and then she began to undress the body.When she came to the stockings she drew off one easily, but at the othershe had to pull so hard that at last the leg came off with it. Saddaeddatook the leg, carried it to her lonely home, and locked it up in a box. Atnight came the dead lady and knocked at the door."Who's there?" said the girl."It is I," answered the corpse. "Give me back my leg and stocking!"But Saddaedda paid no heed to the request. Next day she prepared afeast and invited some of her playfellows to spend the night with her.They came, feasted, and went to sleep. At midnight the dead woman began toknock at the door and to repeat last night's request. Saddaedda took nonotice of the noise, but her companions, whom it awoke, were horrified,and as soon as they could, they ran away. On the third night just the samehappened. On the fourth she could persuade only one girl to keep hercompany.On the fifth she was left entirely alone. The corpse came, forced open thedoor, strode up to Saddaedda's bed, and strangled her. Then the dead womanopened the box, took out her leg and stocking, and carried them off withher to her grave.
