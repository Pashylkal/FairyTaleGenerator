Before there were any Counts of Mansfeld, a knight by the name of Georgelived in Mansfeld Castle. A lindorm lived ona hill outside the city (in the direction of Eisleben), and even todaythis hill is called Lindberg. To save their ownlives, the inhabitants had to give a maiden to the lindorm every day as atribute. Soon there were no more virgins tobe found in the little city, and the lindorm demanded the knight'sdaughter. The following morning the knight himselfchallenged the dragon and slew him, freeing the city. Henceforth he wascalled Saint George, instead of George.As a memorial the image of him killing the dragon was carved in stoneabove the Mansfeld church entrance, and can be seen even today.
