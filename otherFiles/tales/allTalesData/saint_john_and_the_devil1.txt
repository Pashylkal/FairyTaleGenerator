Saint John and the devil were sitting together on the roof of a house.They made a wager as to who would first be able to string together acertain number of small wooden shingles. Saint John took only short piecesof string, pulled them through the nail holes, then tied all the stringstogether, and thus he had all the shingles strung together.On the other hand, the devil clumsily took hold of a very long string andworked feverishly away. Because his string was always getting tangled up,the devil had to keep running back and forth in order to untangle it, andhe was only half finished when Saint John had completed his work.The devil was very angry at having lost this first wager. He then pointedto a field and said, "Let us take what is growing there and share it, eachof us to receive half. Do you want the top or the bottom?"Saint John looked and saw that it was a field of turnips. He chose thebottom half. The devil was happy to get the top half, thinking that it wasthe best part, the bottom part being only thin, bitter roots.The two returned when the turnips had grown and were ready to harvest.Then the devil received only a little pile of half withered, wormy leaves,whereas Saint John received a large pile of the most beautiful andjuiciest turnips.When the devil became angry again, Saint John pointed to another field andasked, "Do you want to wager once again?""Yes indeed," replied the devil, "but this time I'll take the bottomhalf.""Then I'll take the top part," said John.However, this field was planted with wheat, and when harvest time came,Saint John received the beautiful heads, heavy with grain, while the devilwas left with the naked stubble.The devil did not enter into any new wagers, but instead, filled withanger and rage, returned to hell.
