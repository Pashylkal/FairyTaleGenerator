The Scottish Fairies, in like manner, sometimes reside in subterraneanabodes, in the vicinity of human habitations, or, according to the popularphrase, under the "door stane," or threshold. in which situation, theysometimes establish an intercourse with men, by borrowing and lending, andother kindly offices. In this capacity they are termed "the goodneighbors," from supplying privately the wants of their friends, andassisting them in all their transactions, while their favors areconcealed. Of this the traditionary story of Sir Godfrey Macculloch formsa curious example.As this Gallovidian gentleman was taking the air on horseback, near hisown house, he was suddenly accosted by a little old man, arrayed in green,and mounted upon a white palfrey. After mutual salutation, the old mangave Sir Godfrey to understand, that he resided under his habitation, andthat he had great reason to complain of the direction of a drain, orcommon sewer, which emptied itself directly into his chamber of dais.*Sir Godfrey Macculloch was a good deal startled at this extraordinarycomplaint. but, guessing the nature of the being he had to deal with, heassured the old man, with great courtesy, that the direction of the drainshould be altered. and caused it to be done accordingly.Many years afterwards, Sir Godfrey had the misfortune to kill, in a fray,a gentleman of the neighborhood. He was apprehended, tried, andcondemned.† The scaffold, upon which his head was to be struck off,was erected on the Castle Hill of Edinburgh. but hardly had he reached thefatal spot, when the old man, upon his white palfrey, pressed through thecrowd, with the rapidity of lightning. Sir Godfrey, at his command, sprungon behind him . the "good neighbor" spurred his horse down the steep bank,and neither he nor the criminal were ever again seen.
