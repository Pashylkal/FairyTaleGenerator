Warmer the sun shone, and warmer yet. The pines were green now. Allthe snow had melted off them, drip, drip, the falling drops of watermaking tiny wells in the snow under the trees. And the snow under thetrees was melting too. Much had gone, and now there were only patchesof snow in the forest like scraps of a big white blanket, shrinkingevery day."Isn't it lucky our blankets don't shrink like that?" said Maroosia.Old Peter laughed."What do you do when the warm weather comes?" he asked. "Do you stillwear sheepskin coats? Do you still roll up at night under the rugs?""No," said Maroosia. "I throw the rugs off, and put my fluffy coataway till next winter.""Well," said old Peter, "and God, the Father of us all, He does forthe earth just what you do for yourself. but He does it better. Forthe blankets He gives the earth in winter get smaller and smaller asthe warm weather comes, little by little, day by day.""And then a hard frost comes, grandfather," said Ivan."God knows all about that, little one," said old Peter, "and it's forthe best. It's good to have a nip or two in the spring, to make youfeel alive. Perhaps it's His way of telling the earth to wake up. Forthe whole earth is only His little one after all."That night, when it was story time, Ivan and Maroosia consultedtogether. and when old Peter asked what the story was to be, they wereready with an answer."The snow is all melting away," said Ivan."The summer is coming," said Maroosia."We'd like the tale of the little snow girl," said Ivan."'The Little Daughter of the Snow,'" said Maroosia.Old Peter shook out his pipe, and closed his eyes under his bushyeyebrows, thinking for a minute. Then he began.
