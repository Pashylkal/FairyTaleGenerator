A straw, a coal, and a bean formed a group in order to take a long triptogether. They had already gone through many lands when they came to abrook with no bridge, and they could not get across. Finally Straw cameupon a good idea. He would lay himself over the water, and the otherswould walk across him, first Coal and then Bean. Coal walked ahead, andBean came tripping after. But when Coal reached the middle of the straw,it caught fire and burned through. Coal fell into the water hissing, anddied. Straw floated away in two pieces.Bean, who had lagged behind, also slid in, but he managed to keepbarely afloat by swimming. However, he swallowed so much water that heburst, and in this condition drifted ashore. Fortunately a tailor wassitting there, resting from his travels. He had needle and thread at hand,and he sewed Bean back together. And from that time forth, all beans havehad a seam.According to another story, it was the bean who first walked across thestraw. He got across safely, and from the opposite bank watched the coalattempt to cross. Midway the coal burned the straw in two, and fell intothe water hissing. When the bean saw this, he laughed so loudly that heburst. The tailor, who was sitting on the bank, sewed him back together,but he had only black thread, and for this reason all beans have a blackseam.
