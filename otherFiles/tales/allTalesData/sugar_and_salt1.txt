Once upon a time there was a father who had two daughters. Calling themto him one day he said to them, "What is the sweetest thing in the world?""Sugar," said the elder daughter."Salt," said the younger.The father was angry at this last answer. But his daughter stuck to it,and so her father said to her, "I won't keep a daughter in my house whobelieves that salt is the sweetest thing in the world. You must leave meand seek another home."So the younger daughter left her father's house and wandered here andthere, suffering much hunger and cold, until t last she was befriended bythe fairies. As she walked through a wood one day listening to the songsof the birds, a prince came hunting for deer, and when he saw her he fellin love with her at once. She agreed to marry him, and a great banquet wasprepared at the prince's house. To this banquet the bride's father wasbidden. but he did not know that the bride was his own daughter.Now, at the wish of the bride, all the dishes were prepared withoutsalt. So when the guests began to eat they found that the food wastasteless. At last one of them said, "There is no salt in the meat!"And then all the guests said, "There is no salt in the meat!"And the bride's father spoke the loudest of all. "Truly, salt is thesweetest thing in the world," he said, "though, for saying so, I sent myown daughter away from my house, and shall never see her face again."Then the bride made herself known to her father, and fell on his neckand kissed him.
