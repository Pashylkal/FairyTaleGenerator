The Story of a Changeling at DessauEight years ago (in the year 1532) at Dessau, I, Dr. Martin Luther, sawand touched a changeling. It was twelve years old, and from its eyes andthe fact that it had all of its senses, one could have thought that itwas a real child. It did nothing but eat. in fact, it ate enough for anyfour peasants or threshers. It ate, shit, and pissed, and wheneversomeone touched it, it cried. When bad things happened in the house, itlaughed and was happy. but when things went well, it cried. It had thesetwo virtues. I said to the Princes of Anhalt: "If I were the prince orthe ruler here, I would throw this child into the water into the Moldathat flows by Dessau. I would dare commit homicidium on him!"But the Elector of Saxony, who was with me at Dessau, and the Princes ofAnhalt did not want to follow my advice. Therefore, I said: "Then youshould have all Christians repeat the Lord's Prayer in church that Godmay exorcise the devil." They did this daily at Dessau, and thechangeling child died in the following year.... Such a changeling childis only a piece of flesh, a massa carnis, because it has no soul.
