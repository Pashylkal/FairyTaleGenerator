Once upon a time there was a teeny tiny woman lived in a teeny tinyhouse in a teeny tiny village.Now, one day this teeny tiny woman put on her teeny tiny bonnet, and wentout of her teeny tiny house to take a teeny tiny walk. And when thisteeny tiny woman had gone a teeny tiny way she came to a teeny tiny gate.So the teeny tiny woman opened the teeny tiny gate, and went into ateeny tiny churchyard. And when this teeny tiny woman had got into theteeny tiny churchyard, she saw a teeny tiny bone on a teeny tiny grave,and the teeny tiny woman said to her teeny tiny self, "This teeny tinybone will make me some teeny tiny soup for my teeny tiny supper."So the teeny tiny woman put the teeny tiny bone into her teeny tinypocket, and went home to her teeny tiny house.Now when the teeny tiny woman got home to her teeny tiny house she wasa teeny tiny bit tired. So she went up her teeny tiny stairs to herteeny tiny bed, and put the teeny tiny bone into a teeny tiny cupboard.And when this teeny tiny woman had been to sleep a teeny tiny time, shewas awakened by a teeny tiny voice from the teeny tiny cupboard, whichsaid,"Give me my bone!"And this teeny tiny woman was a teeny tiny frightened, so shehid her teeny tiny head under the teeny tiny clothes and went to sleepagain. And when she had been to sleep again a teeny tiny time, theteeny tiny voice again cried out from the teeny tiny cupboard a teeny tinylouder,"Give me my bone!"This made the teeny tiny woman a teeny tiny more frightened, so he hidher teeny tiny head a teeny tiny further under the teeny tiny clothes. Andwhen the teeny tiny woman had been to sleep again a teeny tiny time, theteeny tiny voice from the teeny tiny cupboard said again a teeny tinylouder,"Give me my bone!"And this teeny tiny woman was a teeny tiny bit more frightened,but she put her teeny tiny head out of the teeny tiny clothes, and said inher loudest teeny tiny voice, "TAKE IT!"
