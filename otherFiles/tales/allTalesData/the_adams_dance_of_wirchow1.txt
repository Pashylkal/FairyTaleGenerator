Near Wirchow in Neumark there is a circle of eighteen large stones.Fourteen of them are between two and two and a half feet high, and they stand inpairs, forming a large circle around two other stones, which stand in the middleof the circle. These two are more than two yards high. Two additional stones,still somewhat taller, stand outside the circle some distance removed.About the origin of these stones it is related that at this place severalhundred years ago a number of people gathered on Holy Whitsunday to carryout a naked dance.As special punishment for their wicked behavior they were turned intostones. Thus the stones are called "the Adam's Dance," or "the Stone Dance." Thefourteen stones in the circle were the male and female dancers. The twoin the middle were the beer servers, and the two outside the circle were themusicians. One can still see violins on these latter ones.
