Once the fox and the bear made up their minds to have a field in common.They found a small clearing far away in the forest, where they sowed ryethe first year."Now we must share and share alike," said Reynard. "If you will have theroots I will have the tops," he said.Yes, Bruin was quite willing. But when they had threshed the crop, the foxgot all the grain, while the bear got nothing but the roots and tares.Bruin didn't like this, but the fox said it was only as they had agreed."This year I am the gainer," said the fox. "Another year it will be yourturn. You can then have the tops, and I will be satisfied with the roots."Next spring the fox asked the bear if he didn't think turnips would be theright thing for that year."Yes, that better food than grain," said the bear, and the fox thought thesame.When the autumn came the fox took the turnips, but the bear only got thetops.The bear then became so angry that he parted company then and there withReynard.
