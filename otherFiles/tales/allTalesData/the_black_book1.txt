In Sabitz near Bergen there formerly lived a number of peasants who, itwas said, possessed a black book. With its help they were able to acquiresubstantial wealth, and if they did anything bad to a neighbor, theyalways went unpunished. Whoever wanted to use the black book had to readthe text forwards and backwards. The devil gained control of anyone whofailed to read it backwards. It was no longer known where the book camefrom. The oldest people knew only that they had come into its possessionthrough an inheritance. Sometimes the book caused its owners much grief,so finally they tried to dispose of it. For a long time these attemptswere to no avail, until they sought the advise of a pastor. He freed themfrom the book by nailing shut the drawer in which it was being stored.
