The following legend, very commonly narrated in Northamptonshire, placesthis (the Bogies lack of cunning) in a strong light:One of these spirits (a Bogie) once asserted a claim to a field hithertopossessed by a farmer, and, after much disputing, they came to anarrangement by agreeing to divide its produce between them. At seed timethe farmer asks the Bogie what part of the crop he will have, "tops orbottoms.""Bottoms," said the spirit. Upon hearing which his crafty antagonist sowsthe field with wheat, so that when harvest arrived the corn (grain) fallsto his share, while the poor Bogie is obliged to content himself with thestubble.Next year the Bogie, finding he had made such an unfortunate selection inthe bottoms, chose the "tops," whereupon the crafty farmer sets the fieldwith turnips   thus, again, outwitting the simple claimant.Tired of this unprofitable farming, the Bogie agrees to hazard his claimson a mowing match, the land in question to be the stake for which theyplayed. Before the day of meeting the canny earth tiller procures a numberof iron bars, which he strews among the grass to be mown by his opponent.and when the trial commences, the unsuspecting goblin finds his progressretarded by his scythe continually coming into contact with theseobstacles, which he takes to be some hard species of dock."Mortal hard docks these!" said he. "Nation hard docks!"His blunted blade soon brings him to a standstill. and as, in such cases,it is not allowable for one to sharpen without the other, he turns to hisantagonist, now far ahead, and in a tone of despair inquires, "When dyewiffle waffle (whet), mate?""Waffle!" said the farmer, with a well feigned stare of amazement, "oh,about noon, mebby.""Then," said the despairing Bogie, "I've lost my land!"So saying, he disappeared, and the farmer reaped the reward of hisartifice by ever afterwards continuing the undisputed possessor of thesoil.
