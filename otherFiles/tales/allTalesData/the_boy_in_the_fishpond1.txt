In the times of Agelmund, the King of the Langobards, it happened thata woman of this tribe gave birth to seven baby boys at one time. Beingmore brutal than wild animals, she threw them all into a fishpond toescape the shame. Just then the king rode past the pond, and he saw themiserable children floating there. Stopping his horse, he turned themfrom one side to the other with the spear he held in his hand. One of thechildren grasped the royal spear firmly with his little hand. The kingrecognized in this event a sign that this child was to become a specialman. He ordered that he be pulled from the fishpond and turned him overto a wet nurse for care.Because he had pulled him from a fishpond, which in their language wascalled a lama , he named the child Lamissio. He grew up and becamea valiant hero. Following the death of Agelmund he became King of theLangobards.
