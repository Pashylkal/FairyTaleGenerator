One day a little boy named Elonen sat out in the yard making a bird snare,andas he worked, a little bird called to him: "Tik tik lo den" (come andcatchme)."I am making a snare for you," said the boy. but the bird continued tocalluntil the snare was finished.Then Elonen ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it, and heput itin a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim.While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird, andwhenElonen returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so sad that hewishedhe might go away and never come back. He went out into the forest andwalked along distance, until finally he came to a big stone and said: "Stone, openyourmouth and eat me." And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed theboy.When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere,hopingto find him. Finally she passed near the stone and it cried out: "Here heis."Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not, so shecalled thehorses to come and help her. They came and kicked it, but it would notbreak.Then she called the carabao and they hooked it, but they only broke theirhorns.She called the chickens, which pecked it, and the thunder, which shookit, butnothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy.
