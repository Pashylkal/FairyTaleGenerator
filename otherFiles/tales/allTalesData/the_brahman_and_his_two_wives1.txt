In the Dakhan lived a Brahman who hadtwo wives. To the elder of these a son wasborn.When the son was about ten monthsold, the old Brahman set out with his family ona pilgrimage to Benares (Varanasi), but he unfortunatelydied on his way.The two women thereupon"went to an adjacent agraharam (the Brahmans'quarters in a city or village), and remainedthere, rearing the boy with great affection, somuch so that the child knew not which of thetwo was his real mother.But one day the younger lady quarrelled with the elder,and, declaring that she would no longerremain with her, took the child and set out togo home.The elder thereupon seized the childand demanded of the other why she was takinghim away.The younger replied that as shehad borne the child she was going away withhim.So the two still disputing went to theJudge and told their story. He reflected alittle, called his servants and ordered themto divide the child in twain and to give eacha half.The younger lady remained silent, butthe elder, being the real mother, was of opinionthat so long as the child did but live itwas enough. and, not consenting the Judge'sproposal, said to him that the child was nother own, and requested him to give it to theother lady.The Judge, hearing these words,decided that the elder lady was the child'smother, and had the boy given to her.
