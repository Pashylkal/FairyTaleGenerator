There was once a Brahman who had two wives. Like many Brahmans he livedby begging and was very clever at wheedling money out of people. One daythe fancy took him to go to the marketplace dressed only in a smallloincloth such as the poorest laborers wear and see how people treatedhim. So he set out, but on the road and in the marketplace and in thevillage no one salaamed to him or made way for him, and when he begged noone gave him alms.He soon got tired of this and hastened home and, putting on his bestpagri (turban) and coat and dhoti (waistcloth), went back tothe marketplace. This time everyone who met him on the road salaamed lowto him and made way for him, and every shopkeeper to whom he went gave himalms. and the people in the village who had refused before gladly madeofferings to him.The Brahman went home smiling to himself and took off his clothes andput them in a heap and prostrated himself before them three or four times,saying each time, "O source of wealth! O source of wealth! It is clothesthat are honored in this world and nothing else."
