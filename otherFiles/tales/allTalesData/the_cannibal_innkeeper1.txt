Once there was a poor orphan girl who worked as a servant at the houseof a rich man. Her dearest companion was a little dog that her parents hadgiven her before they died.One day the chieftain of a robber band, disguised as an ordinaryservant, came to the rich man's house and asked the girl to marry him.Sensing something sinister about him, the girl rejected the suitor'sadvances, so, with the assistance of his fellow robbers, he carried heraway by force.Now a prisoner in the robber's house, the girl still refused to marryhim, in spite of his friendly words, his threats, and his abuse. Finallyhe gave up his attempts to win her love, and sold her to a wild and cruelinnkeeper.Now this innkeeper would rob travelers, kill them, cut them intopieces, and serve their cooked flesh to his other guests. He terrorizedthe poor girl by showing her the valuables he had stolen from his victims,the room where he murdered them, and the weapons he used for his wickeddeeds. Then he locked her and her little dog in an adjoining room.Soon afterward he brought in a little boy whom he had captured in thewoods gathering berries. He cut off the boy's head and cut him intopieces. Then he forced the girl to cook the boy's flesh and serve it tothe innkeeper's guests.Some time later the innkeeper brought in a very old woman, ugly andwrinkled, and nothing but skin and bones. Perhaps wanting to fatten her upfor later, he locked her in the room with the girl and her dog.After their captor had left, the old woman told the girl that thecannibal innkeeper was her own son, and that she, disguised so well thathe could not recognize her, had come to punish him for his wickedness.Skilled in witchcraft, the old woman told the girl how she could escape.She would first have to kill her little dog and eat a piece of its heart.The girl did this, and then the old woman rubbed some ointment all overthe girl's body, which transformed her into a duck.A little later the wild man opened the door, and the duck flew over hishead, escaping into the open. The innkeeper ran from room to room lookingfor the girl, and his mother uttered a magic curse that caused the houseto collapse upon him, killing him at once.The girl turned around and saw the heap of ruins, but as the old womanhad not told her how she could again become a human being, she hasremained a duck to this very day.
