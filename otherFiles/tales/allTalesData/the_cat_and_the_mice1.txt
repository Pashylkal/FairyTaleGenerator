A certain house was much infested by mice. The owner brought home acat, afamous mouser, who soon made such havocamong the little folk that those who were left stayed closely in the uppershelves. Then the cat grew hungry and thin,and, driven by her wit's end, hung by her hind legs to a peg in the walland pretended to be dead in order that themice would no longer be afraid to come near her.An old mouse came to the edge of the shelf, and, seeing through the trick,cried out, "Ah ha, Mrs. Pussy! We shouldnot come near you, even if your skin were stuffed with straw."Moral: Old birds are not to be caught with chaff.
