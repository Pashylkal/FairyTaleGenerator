There was once a house that was overrun with mice. A cat heard of this,and said to herself, "That's the place for me," and off she went and tookup her quarters in the house, and caught the mice one by one and atethem.At last the mice could stand it n longer, and they determined to taketo their holes and stay there."That's awkward," said the cat to herself. "The only thing to do is tocoax them out by a trick." So she considered a while, and then climbed upthe wall and let herself hang down by her hind legs from a peg, andpretended to be dead.By and by a mouse peeped out and saw the cat hanging there. "Aha!" itcried, "You're very clever, madam, no doubt. But you may turn yourselfinto a bag of meal hanging there, if you like, yet you won't catch uscoming anywhere near you."If you are wise you won't be deceived by the innocent airsof those whom you have once found to be dangerous.
