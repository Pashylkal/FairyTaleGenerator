A carman was leaving Bunclody one morning for Dublin, when what shouldhe see but a neighbor's cat galloping along the side of the road, andcrying out every moment, "Tell Moll Browne, Tom Dunne is dead. Tell MollBrowne, Tom Dunne is dead."At last he got tired of this ditty, and took up a stone and flung it atthe cat, bidding himself, and Tom Browne, and Moll Dunne, to go toHalifax, and not be botherin' him.When he got to Luke Byrne's in Francis Street, where all the Wicklowand Wexford carmen used to stop, he was taking a pot of beer in thetaproom, and began to tell the quare thing that happened on the road.There was a comfortable looking gray cat sitting by the fire, and themoment he mentioned what the Bunclody cat was saying, she cried out,"That's my husband!" That's my husband!"She made only one leap out through the door, and no one ever saw her atLuke Byrne's again.
