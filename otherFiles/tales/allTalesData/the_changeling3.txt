German LegendsAt Hessloch near Odernheim in the Gau the servant and the cook of aclergyman were living together as man and wife, although they had notbeen able to have their relationship publicly consecrated. They had achild together, but it failed to grow and gain weight. It cried day andnight, always demanding to be fed.Finally the woman sought advice, and was told that the baby would improveif she would take it to Neuhausen on the Cyriak Meadow, have it weighedthere, and give it water from the Cyriak Spring. At that time it wasbelieved that in such cases a child thus would be restored to health orwould die within nine days. (Note 1)As the woman approached the millrace near Westhofen, the child, whom shewas carrying on her back, became so heavy that she began to pant, and thesweat began running from her face. At that moment a traveling studentapproached her, saying: "Woman, what sort of wild creature are youcarrying? It will be a miracle if it doesn't break your neck!"She answered that it was her own dear child that would neither grow norgain weight, and that she was therefore taking it to Neuhausen to have itweighed.He replied: "That is not your child! It is the devil! (Note 2) Throwhim into the brook!"She did not want to do this, insisting that it was her child whilekissing it.He continued: "Your child is at home in a new cradle behind the chest inthe side room. Throw this monster into the brook!"Crying and sobbing she did has she had been told. Immediately thereissued a great cry and commotion from beneath the bridge she was standingon, like the howling of wolves and bears. And when the mother arrivedhome, she found her baby, hearty and healthy, laughing in its new cradle.
