The Legend Book of LausitzA child must always have someone nearby until it is six weeks old.Otherwise, an old woman from the woods or the mountains could come andexchange a physically and mentally retarded, malformed changeling for theinfant. At the very least, one must place a hymnbook near the child'shead before leaving the room. However, if through negligence themisfortune does occur, you should take prompt notice of it. Then youneed only make a switch from the branches of a weeping birch tree andbeat the changeling severely with it. The old woman will respond to hiscries by bringing back the exchanged child and taking the beastly childaway. You must allow her to depart unhindered, neither scolding norcursing her, otherwise you will be left with the changeling hanging onyour neck.
