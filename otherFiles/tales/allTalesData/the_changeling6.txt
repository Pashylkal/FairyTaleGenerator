Legends from the Iglau Language Island (inMoravia)An old midwife related this, so it must be true. Until a child isbaptized, mysterious beings attempt to steal it and put a changeling inits place. Such a changeling has a large head with coal black hair and asmall body with thin legs, which do not learn to walk. When thismisfortune occurs, one must beat the changeling without mercy until thethief returns the right child.A woman had laid her as yet unbaptized baby in a canopied bed. Thecherries had just ripened, and the red, tempting fruit was beckoningthrough the window from the garden. The new mother could not resist, andwent outside to pick a few cherries. She had scarcely crossed thethreshold when she was overcome by anxiety for her slumbering child, andshe quickly returned. There was, in fact, a being standing next to thebed. The woman cried out and the being disappeared. The imprint of itshorrible paw, where it had grabbed for the child, could still be seen onthe canopied bed.
