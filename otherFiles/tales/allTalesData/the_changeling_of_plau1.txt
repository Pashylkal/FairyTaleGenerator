They shared their concern with an old man, who said: "For surethe underground people have exchanged your child. If you want to becertain about this, then take an empty eggshell and in the presence ofthe child pour fresh beer into it, then add yeast to make it ferment. Ifthe child then starts to talk, then my suspicion is right." Theyfollowed this advice.
