In the very early days before there were any people on the earth, thelimokon (a kind of dove ) were very powerful and could talk like menthough they looked like birds. One limokon laid two eggs, one at the mouthof the Mayo River and one farther up its course. After some time theseeggs hatched, and the one at the mouth of the river became a man, whilethe other became a woman.The man lived alone on the bank of the river for a long time, but he wasvery lonely and wished many times for a companion. One day when he wascrossing the river something was swept against his legs with such forcethat it nearly caused him to drown. On examining it, he found that it wasa hair, and he determined to go up the river and find whence it came. Hetraveled up the stream, looking on both banks, until finally he found thewoman, and he was very happy to think that at last he could have acompanion.They were married and had many children, who are the Mandaya still livingalong the Mayo River.
