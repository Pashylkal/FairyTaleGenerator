The Holy One gathered the dust for the creation of the first man from thefour corners of the earth, The Spirit of Life asked God why did He dothis.The Holy One replied, "If a man should chance to come from the East to theWest, or from the West to the East or to any place on the face of theearth, and his time comes to depart from this world, then the dust of theearth which is in that place where he dies shall not say to him: 'The dustof thy body is not mine. Thou wast not born here in this land. Return tothe place whence thy dust was gathered at thy birth.' It is for thisreason that I have taken the dust to form man from the four corners of theearth. Every place on earth is man's home. Wheresoever he happens to bewhen he dies there is the resting place for the dust of his body and thereit returns to Mother Earth."The Spirit of Life praised the Lord whose mercies are over all His works.
