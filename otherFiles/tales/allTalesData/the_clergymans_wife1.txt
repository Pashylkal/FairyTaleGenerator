At this unusual callshe took counsel with her husband, who, however, deemed it best for her togo. Her guide led her into a splendid building, the rooms whereof were asclean and elegant as those of very illustrious folk. and in a beautifulbed lay a still more beautiful woman, for whom her services were required,and who was no other than Vitra herself.Under the midwife's care Vitra speedily gave birth to a fair girl, andin a few minutes had entirely recovered, and fetched all sorts ofrefreshments, which she laid before her benefactress. The latter refusedto eat, in spite of Vitra's reassuring persuasion, and further refused themoney which the troll wife pressed upon her. Vitra then sent her home,bidding her look on the table when next she entered her cowherd hut andsee what she would find there. She thought no more of the matter untilthe following spring, when on entering the hut she found on the table halfa dozen large spoons of pure silver with her name engraved thereon in neatletters.These spoons long remained an heirloom in the clergyman's family totestify the truth of the story.
