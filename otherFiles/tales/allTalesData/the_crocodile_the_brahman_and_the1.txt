FoxA crocodile beseeched a Brahman to carry it to Benares, so it couldlive in the Ganges. Touched with compassion, the Brahman put the crocodileinto his bag and carried it to the holy river. However, just as he wasabout to release the crocodile into the water, the latter seized him, andwas about to kill him. The Brahman accused his captor of ingratitude, whoin turn replied that virtue and custom allowed one to eat the person whohad sustained him. The Brahman insisted that three impartial judges shoulddecide the case, and declared himself willing to abide by theirdecision.They turned first to a mango tree, whom the Brahman asked if it werepermitted to repay a good deed with evil. The mango tree replied thatsuch was the treatment he and his kind always received from humans. "Theypartake of our fruits and of our shade, and then uproot us," it said.Next they turned to an old cow. She too said that humans had abandonedher after she was of no more use to them. Any moment she expected to fallprey to a wild animal.They still needed a third judgment, and for this they turned to a fox.He too seemed inclined against the Brahman, but before finalizing hisdecision, he wanted to see how the two had journeyed together. Todemonstrate, the unsuspecting crocodile crept back into the Brahman's bag.Acting on a cue from the fox, the Braham struck the now helpless crocodiledead with a stone, and the fox ate it up.
