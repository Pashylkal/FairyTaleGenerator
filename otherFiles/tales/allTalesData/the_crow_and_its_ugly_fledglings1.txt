Of all the birds the crow is considered the ugliest, especially itsyoung fledglings. The legend tells that sometime after God had created allthe living beings, he called everyone to see them and their offspring. Hewanted to see how the young birds and animals looked, and then to givethem suitable gifts, and food for their little ones.They came one by one, and God looked at them, patted some and strokedothers, and was very pleased with every one of them, for each one hadsomething of beauty in it. And so he blessed them and gave them food bywhich to live. The last to come was the crow, bringing her little broodwith her, very proud of them.When God cast his eyes upon the young crows, he spat in astonishment,and said, "Surely these are not my creatures. I could not have made suchugly things. Every one of my creatures has such beautiful young ones thatthey are a pleasure to look at, but yours are so ugly that it makes onesick to look at them. Where did you get this one?""Where should I get them from?" replied the crow. "It is my very ownyoung child," she added with pride."You had better go back and bring me another one. This is much toougly. I cannot look at it."Annoyed at the words of God, the crow went away and flew all over theearth to search for another young one that would be more beautiful thanthe one she had brought to God. But no other young bird appeared sobeautiful in her eyes as her own. So she returned back to God and said, "Ihave been all over the world, and I have searched high and low, but youngbirds more beautiful and more dainty than mine I have not been able tofind."Then God smilingly replied, "Quite right. Just so are all mothers. Noother child is so beautiful in their eyes as their own."Then he blessed the little crows and sent them away into the world withhis gifts.
