Afterward his right hand was cut off, thenhis heart was pulled from his body, and finally he was quartered and thefour parts of his body were hung on four posts near the gallows. Thecut off hand was nailed up as well. Although the birds pulled the otherpieces apart and ate them, they did not touch the hand.
