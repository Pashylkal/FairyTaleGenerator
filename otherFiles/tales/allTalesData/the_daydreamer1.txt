Once an oil man was going to market with his pots of oil arranged on aflat basket, and he engaged a Santal for two annas to carry the basket.And as he went along, the Santal thought:With one anna I will buy food and with the other I will buy chickens, andthe chickens will grow up and multiply, and then I will sell some of thefowls and eggs, and with the money I will buy goats. And when the goatsincrease, I will sell some and buy cows, and then I will exchange some ofthe calves for she buffaloes, and when the buffaloes breed, I will sellsome and buy land and start cultivation, and then I will marry and havechildren, and I will hurry back from my work in the fields, and my wifewill bring me water, and I will have a rest, and my children will say tome, "Father, be quick and wash your hands for dinner," but I will shake myhead and say, 'No, no, not yet!"And as he thought about it he really shook his head, and the basketfell to the ground, and all the pots of oil were smashed.Then the oil man abused him and said that he must pay two rupees forthe oil and one anna for the pots. But the Santal said that he had lostmuch more than that, and the oil man asked him how that could be, and theSantal explained how with his wages he was going to get fowls and thengoats and then oxen and buffaloes and land, and how he came to spill thebasket, and at that the oil man roared with laughter and said, "Well, Ihave made up the account, and I find that our losses are equal, so we willcry quits." And so saying they went their ways laughing.
