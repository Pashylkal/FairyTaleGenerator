Once there was a king who died. His wife and two children, a girl and aboy, were still alive. Then one day they asked the mother which of themshould someday become king. She said to them, "Dear children, go out intothe woods together and look for a certain flower. The first one of you tofind it will someday become king."So the two set forth together, and while searching in the woods theyseparated, and the girl was the first one to find the flower. She thoughtshe would wait for her brother, so she put the flower in her hand, closedit in God's name, and lay down in the shade.Then the boy came to her. He had not found the flower, but when he sawit in his sister's hand, a terrible thought came to him: "I will murder mysister, take the flower home with me, and then I will become king."That is what he thought, and that is what he did. He killed her andburied her in the woods, covering with earth so that no one would knowwhat had happened.Many years later a shepherd boy who was there tending his sheep foundone of the girl's bones lying on the ground. He made a few holes in itlike a flute, and blew into it. Then the bone began to sing ever so sadlyand told the entire story how the girl had been killed by her brother. Tohear the song would bring tears to your eyes.One day a knight came by where the boy was playing the flute. He boughtthe flute and played it wherever he went in the land. Finally the oldqueen heard the knight and became very sad. She had her son removed fromthe throne, and she mourned for the rest of her life.
