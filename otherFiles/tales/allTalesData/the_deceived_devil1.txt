A young man made the following contract with the devil: The devil wasto provide the man with money. In return, at a predetermined time the manwas to give the devil work that would keep him busy an entire day. If theman were able to do this, then the devil would have given him the moneyfor nothing. If he were not able to do this, then the man would belong tothe devil, and the latter would be able to take him away.It came to pass that the time lapsed just as the man was celebratinghis wedding. A boy came up to him and told him that a strange gentlemanwas outside who wanted to speak with him. The man immediately rememberedthe devil and did not go. The boy returned and called for him again, butstill he did not go.Then the devil came inside personally and demanded either a task or theman himself. The man showed him a field of clover and told him to mow it.This would have taken a single man several days, but the devil finished itin an instant and demanded another task. Then the man took a bushel ofclover seeds, scattered them over the field, and told the devil to gatherthem back up. It was a simple matter for him, and he was finished in ahalf hour. The man became terrified when the devil asked for yet anothertask.Then the man's bride noticed her husband's concern and said, "What isthe matter? Why do you keep running in and out?"The man confessed everything to her and told her of the danger that henow faced.The bride said, "I will help you. You should have told me about itearlier!" Plucking out one of her short curly hairs, she gave it to herhusband and said, "Take this to the devil and demand that he straightenit!"The man did this. The devil made an ugly face, then picked and pulledand bent away at the hair. He even placed it on an anvil and tried topound it straight with a hammer, but it was all for nothing. The devil wasnot able to complete this task that day. The hair remained curly andcrooked, and he was tricked out of his prize.
