In stories we read about two young married people who loved one anotherwithall their hearts and got along ever so well together. Now the devil wantedto sow discord between them so they would no longer love one another.He went to an old whore, a wicked woman, and offered her a pair of redshoes if she could sow discord between the married people.The old slut accepted the challenge, then went to the man and said,"Listen, your wife is planning to kill you."The man said, "That cannot be true. I know that my wife loves mesincerely.""No," said the old woman, "she is in love with someone else, and sheintends to slit your throat."Thus she succeeded in making the man afraid of his wife. He thought thatsomething horrible might happen to him.Soon afterward the old slut went to the man's wife and said, "Your husbanddoes not love you."When the wife answered, "I have a pious husband, and I know that he lovesme," the old slut responded, "No, he wants to take another woman, so youshould stop him. Take a razor, put it under his pillow, and kill him."The wife believed the old slut, and the poor, crazy fool became furiouswith her husband.The husband grew suspicious, and, learning from the old whore that hiswife had hidden a razor under his pillow, he waited until his wife wasasleep, found the razor, and killed his wife.Then the old woman came to the devil and demanded the pair of red shoes.The devil reached the shoes to her, but he did so on a long pole, for hewas afraid of her. He said, "Take them. You are wickeder than I am."
