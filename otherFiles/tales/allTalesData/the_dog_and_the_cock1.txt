One day the dog and the cock were walking in the farmyard. The cock wascheerful, flapping his wings and crowing lustily, but the dog hung histail and appeared to be buried in sad thoughts. Angry at the cock'scheerfulness, he said, "I cannot understand how you can be so happy!""Why not?" asked the cock."Can't you see," said the dog, "that our master has been going aroundwith a long face for a few days now? I think that we should be sharing hisconcerns.""What are his concerns?" asked the cock."About his wife," said the dog. "She is so bad that he never gets agood word from her. She is never satisfied with anything he does or says.A woman like that can be the death of a man!""She wouldn't be the death of me," answered the cock. "I have seventywives, and if I ever had to hang my head because something went wrong, thedevil would be in charge, not I. No, I handle them differently. My wivesreceive blows if they are stubborn and don't want to listen to me. And ifthey get in each others' hair, I pull them apart. In this manner I getalong splendidly with my seventy wives, and if our master can't deal withhis one wife, then he is a sorry fellow indeed!" And with that the cockproudly and cheerfully went on his way.Now the master had been listening in on this entire conversation, so hewent to his wife. Once again she had bad words for him, so he answered herwith an appropriate measure of blows, and from that time onward she was astame and agreeable as never before.
