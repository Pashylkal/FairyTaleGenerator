In a certain place there once lived a dog by the name of Tschitranga,which means "having a spotted body." A lengthy famine set in. Because theyhad no food, the dogs and other animals began to leave their families.Tschitranga, whose throat was emaciated with hunger, was driven by fear toanother country. There in a certain city he went to a certain house dayafter day where, due to the carelessness of the housekeeper, many goodthings to eat were left lying about, and he ate his fill. However, uponleaving the house, other vicious dogs surrounded him on all sides and toreinto him on all parts of his body with their teeth. Then he reconsideredhis situation, and said, "It is better at home. Even during a famine youcan live there in peace, and no one bites you to pieces. I will return tomy own city."Having thus thought it through, set forth to his own city. When hearrived there, all of his relatives asked him, "Tschitranga, tell us aboutwhere you have been. What is the country like? How do the people behave?What do they eat? What do they do?"He answered, "How can I explain to you the essence of a foreign place?There are good things to eat in great variety, and housekeepers who do notkeep watch! There is only one evil in a foreign country: You will be hatedthere because of who you are!"
