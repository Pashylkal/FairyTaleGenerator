In a certain place there once lived a dog by the name of Tschitranga,which means "having a spotted body." A lengthy famine set in. Becausethey had no food, the dogs and other animals began to leave theirfamilies. Tschitranga, whose throat was emaciated with hunger, wasdriven by fear to another country. There in a certain city he went to acertain house day after day where, due to the carelessness of thehousekeeper, many good things to eat were left lying about, and he atehis fill. However, upon leaving the house, other vicious dogs surroundedhim on all sides and tore into him on all parts of his body with theirteeth. Then he reconsidered his situation, and said, "It is better athome. Even during a famine you can live there in peace, and no one bitesyou to pieces. I will return to my own city."Having thus thought it through, set forth to his own city. When hearrived there, all of his relatives asked him, "Tschitranga, tell usabout where you have been. What is the country like? How do the peoplebehave? What do they eat? What do they do?"He answered, "How can I explain to you the essence of a foreign place?There are good things to eat in great variety, and housekeepers who donot keep watch! There is only one evil in a foreign country: You willbe hated there because of who you are!"
