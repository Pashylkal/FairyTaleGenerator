It is probably that there are few places more gloomy and uninvitingthan certain parts of the parish of Sibbarp, in the Province of Halland.Dark heaths cover a good portion of the parish, and from their dull brownsurface rises, here and there, a lonely, cheerless mountain. One of theseis Folkared's Cliff, in the southern part of the parish, noted of old asthe abiding place of little trolls and dwarfs.One chilly autumn day a peasant, going from Hogared, in Ljungby, toFolkared, in Sibbarp, in order to shorten his journey took a shortcut byway of the cliff, upon reaching which he perceived a dwarf about the sizeof a child seven or eight years old, sitting upon a stone crying."Where is your home?" asked the peasant, moved by the seeming distressof the little fellow."Here," sobbed the dwarf, pointing to the mountain."How long have you lived here?" questioned the peasant in surprise."Six hundred years.""Six hundred years! You lie, you rascal, and you deserve to be whippedfor it.""Oh! Do not strike me," pleaded the dwarf, continuing to cry. "I havehad enough of blows already today.""Who have you received them from?" asked the peasant."From my father.""What capers did you cut up that you were thus punished?""Oh, I was set to watch my old grandfather and when I chanced to turnmy back he fell and hurt himself upon the floor."The peasant then understood what character of person he had met, andgrasping his dirk he prepared to defend himself. But instantly he heard anawful crash in the mountain, and the dwarf had vanished.
