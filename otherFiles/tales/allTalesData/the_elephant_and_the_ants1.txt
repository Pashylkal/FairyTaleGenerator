In the days of old there was a great deal more jungle than there is now,and wild elephants were very numerous. once upon a time a red ant and ablack ant were burrowing in the ground, when a wild elephant appeared andsaid, "Why are you burrowing here. I will trample all your work topieces."The ants answered, "Why do you talk like this. do not despise us becausewe are small. perhaps we are better than you in some ways."The elephant said, "Do not talk nonsense. There is nothing at which youcould beat me. I am in all ways the largest and most powerful animal onthe face of the earth."Then the ants said, "Well, let us run a race and see who will win, unlessyou win we will not admit that you are supreme."At this the elephant got into a rage and shouted, "Well, come we willstart at once," and it set off to run with all its might and when it gottired it looked down at the ground and there were two ants. So it startedoff again and when it stopped and looked down, there on the ground weretwo ants. So it ran on again, but wherever it stopped it saw the ants, andat last it ran so far that it dropped down dead from exhaustion.Now it is a saying that ants are more numerous in this world than anyother kind of living creature. and what happened was that the two antsnever ran at all, but stayed where they were. but whenever the elephantlooked at the ground, it saw some ants running about and thought that theywere the first two, and so ran itself to death.This story teaches us not to despise the poor man, because one day he mayhave an opportunity to put us to shame.From this story of the elephant we should learn this lesson. the Creatorknows why He made some animals big and some small and why He made some menfools. so we should neither bully nor cheat men who happen to be bornstupid.
