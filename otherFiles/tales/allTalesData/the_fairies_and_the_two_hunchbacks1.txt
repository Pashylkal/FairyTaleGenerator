A Story of PicardyOnce there were three fairies who used to amuse themselves by dancinground and round, and singing, "Sunday, Monday. Sunday, Monday."One day a little hunchback surprised them at this sport, and without beingafraid, he took them by the hand and began to dance with them, repeatingalso, "Sunday, Monday. Sunday, Monday."He danced so prettily that the fairies were charmed, and to reward himtook away his hunch. Perfectly happy, he returned home, constantly singingas he went, "Sunday, Monday. Sunday, Monday."On the road he met another little hunchback whom he knew. The latter wasgreatly astonished to see his friend relieved of his hunch, and said, "Howdid you manage it? Your hunch is gone.""It is all very easy," replied the other. "You have only to go to acertain wood, when you will find some fairies. You must dance with themand sing, 'Sunday, Monday. Sunday, Monday,' and they will take away yourhunch.""I will go, I will go at once," cried the little hunchback, and startedimmediately for the wood to which he had been directed, where, sureenough, he found the three fairies. Without hesitating, he took them bythe hand and danced with them, repeating, "Sunday, Monday." But unhappilyfor him, he added, "Tuesday, Wednesday."The fairies, indignant, added to his hunch that of the first hunchback, sothat he was a fright to behold, so frightful that if you had seen him youwould have run away from him.And then ?   And then the cock crew, and it was day.Told by Auguste Gourdin, miller, aged 63, at Warloy Baillon(Somme).Henri Carnoy.
