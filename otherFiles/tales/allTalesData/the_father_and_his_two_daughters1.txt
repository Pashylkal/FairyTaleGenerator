A man who had two daughters married one to a gardener, the other to apotter. After awhile he paid a visit to the gardener's, and asked hisdaughter how she was and how it fared with her."Excellently well," said she. "we have everything that we want. I have butone prayer, that we may have a heavy storm of rain to water our plants."Off he set to the potter's, and asked his other daughter how matters wentwith her."There is not a thing we want," she replied. "and I only hope this fineweather and hot sun may continue, to bake our tiles.""Alack," said the father, "if you wish for fine weather, and your sisterfor rain, which am I to pray for myself?"
