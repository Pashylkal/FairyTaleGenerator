make up, the other guests ate greedily, and, as for Tubby, nothing evertook away his appetite.When the moment arrived to serve the roast goose, there was a pause, andTubby took the opportunity to lay down his knife and fork for a little.But as the goose gave no sign of appearing, he sent his head carver tofind out what was the matter in the kitchen.Now this was what had happened.While the goose was turning on the spit, a beautiful little canaryhopped on to the sill of the open window.'Good morning, my fine cook,' she said in a silvery voice to the man whowas watching the roast.'Good morning, lovely golden bird,' replied the chief of the scullions,who had been well brought up.'I pray that Heaven may send you to sleep,' said the golden bird, 'andthat the goose may burn, so that there may be none left for Titty.'And instantly the chief of the scullions fell fast asleep, and the goosewas burnt to a cinder.When he awoke he was horrified, and gave orders to pluck another goose,to stuff it with chestnuts, and put it on the spit.While it was browning at the fire, Tubby inquired for his goose a secondtime. The Master Cook himself mounted to the hall to make his excuses,and to beg his lord to have a little patience. Tubby showed his patienceby abusing his son.'As if it wasn't enough,' he grumbled between his teeth, 'that the boyshould pick up a hag without a penny, but the goose must go and burnnow. It isn't a wife he has brought me, it is Famine herself.'
