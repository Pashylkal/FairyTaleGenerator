Five journeymen once left a particular place to travel together, andthey promised one another that they would all stay together. After walkinga good distance, one of them suddenly wondered if they were still allthere, and so he asked his comrades. They all stood still, and one of thembegan counting, "Here am I, one, two, three, four!""Gracious! How concerned they were when one of them turned up missing!"One after the other each one counted, and the result was always four,because everyone missed himself.Then a stranger came by and asked what the trouble was. They told himand asked if he could help. The man told them all to press their nosesinto the mud and then count the holes. This they did, and when they sawthat five noses were there, they knew that they had not lost one of theircomrades, and they happily continued their journey.
