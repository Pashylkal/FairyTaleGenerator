A frog entered into a wager with a snail as to which of them would be thefirst to reach the city. The frog, of course, believed that he would winthe wager because he could travel so much faster than the snail.As they started out the frog made fun of the snail, saying, "Don't crawlalong so. Instead hop like I do. otherwise you will never win the wager."Then away he hopped.However, arriving at the city, he found that the gate was closed, and thushe had to wait until the next morning when the gate would be opened.In the meantime the snail crawled steadily onward, and she too finallyarrived at the city. Of course, she also found the gate closed, but forher that was no obstacle. She simply crawled over it, and thus won thewager.
