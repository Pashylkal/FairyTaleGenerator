Folk Tales and Fairy Lore in Gaelic andEnglishThere once lived in Glengarry a widow with a young child who was a boy.One day she went to the well for water. and when she was returning to thehouse, she heard the child, whom she had left sleeping quietly in thecradle, screaming as if he were in great pain. She hastened in, a gavehim a drink as quickly as she could. This quieted him for a littlewhile, but he soon broke out again as badly as ever. She gave himanother drink. and while he was at her breast she looked at him and sawthat he had two teeth in his mouth, each more than an inch long, and thathis face was as old and withered as any face she had ever seen.She said to herself: "Now I am undone, but I will keep quiet until I seewhat will come of this."Next day she lifted the lad in her arms, put a shawl about him, and wentaway as though she was going to the next farm with him. A bug burn ranacross her path, and when she was going over the ford, the creature puthis head out of the shawl and said: "Many a big fold have I seen on thebanks of this stream!"The woman did not wait to hear more of his history, but threw him into adeep pool below the ford, where he lay for a while, tumbling about andreviling her, and saying if he had known beforehand the trick she wasgoing to play him, he would have shown her another.She then heard a sound like that of a flock of birds flying about her,but saw nothing until she looked at her feet, and there beheld her ownchild with his bones as bare as the tongs. She took him home with her,and he got gradually better, and was at last as healthy as any other child.
