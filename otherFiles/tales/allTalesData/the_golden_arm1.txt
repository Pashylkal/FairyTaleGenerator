There was once a man who traveled the land all over in search of awife. He saw young and old, rich and poor, pretty and plain, and could notmeet with one to his mind. At last he found a woman young, fair, and rich,who possessed the supreme, the crowning glory of having a right arm ofsolid gold. He married her at once, and thought no man so fortunate as hewas. They lived happily together, but, though he wished people to thinkotherwise, he was fonder of the golden arm than of all his wife's giftsbesides.At last she died. The husband appeared inconsolable. He put on theblackest black, and pulled the longest face at the funeral. But for allthat he got up in the middle of the night, dug up the body, and cut offthe golden arm. He hurried home to secrete his recovered treasure, andthought no one would know.The following night he put the golden arm under his pillow, and wasjust falling asleep, when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the room.Stalking up to the bedside it drew the curtain, and looked at himreproachfully. Pretending not to be afraid, he spoke to the ghost, andsaid, "What have you done with your cheeks so red.""All withered and wasted away," replied the ghost, in a hollowtone."What have you done with your red rosy lips?""All withered and wasted away.""What have you done with your golden hair?""All withered and wasted away.""What have you done with your golden arm ?""You have it!"
