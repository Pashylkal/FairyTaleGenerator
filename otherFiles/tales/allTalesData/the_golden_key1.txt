Once in the wintertime when the snow was very deep, a poor boy had togo out and fetch wood on a sled. After he had gathered it together andloaded it, he did not want to go straight home, because he was so frozen,but instead to make a fire and warm himself a little first. So he scrapedthe snow away, and while he was thus clearing the ground he found a smallgolden key. Now he believed that where there was a key, there must also bea lock, so he dug in the ground and found a little iron chest. "If onlythe key fits!" he thought. "Certainly there are valuable things in thechest." He looked, but there was no keyhole. Finally he found one, but sosmall that it could scarcely be seen. He tried the key, and fortunately itfitted. Then he turned it once, and now we must wait until he has finishedunlocking it and has opened the lid. Then we shall find out what kind ofwonderful things there were in the little chest.
