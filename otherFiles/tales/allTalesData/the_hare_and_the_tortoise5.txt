A hare was one day making fun of a tortoise for being so slow upon hisfeet. "Wait a bit," said the tortoise. "I'll run a race with you, and I'llwager that I win.""Oh, well," replied the hare, who was much amused at the idea, "let's tryand see."And it was soon agreed that the fox should set a course for them and bethe judge. When the time came both started off together, but the hare wassoon so far ahead that he thought he might as well have a rest. So down helay and fell fast asleep. Meanwhile the tortoise kept plodding on, and intime reached the goal. At last the hare woke up with a start and dashed onat his fastest, but only to find that the tortoise had already won therace.Slow and steady wins the race.
