There was a woman who had a caged magpie that could talk, and it toldeverything that it saw and whatever anyone did.Now it happened that her husband was saving a fine, large eel in a tub,planning to serve it to a friend for dinner. But one day while he wasaway, his wife caught the eel, cooked it, and ate it herself.She planned to claim that an otter had stolen the eel, but when herhusband came home, her magpie said, "Master, my mistress ate the eel."He went to the tub, and not finding the eel, he asked his wife what hadhappened to it. She started to make an excuse, but he interrupted her, "Iknow that you ate it, because the magpie told me so!" And he scolded herwith angry words.As soon as the man left, the woman grabbed the magpie and pulled everylast feather from its head. "That's your punishment for telling about theeel," she said.From that time forth, whenever the magpie saw bald headed person, itwould cry out, "You too must have told about the eel!"
