Once upon a time there was a peasant and his wife who had a child thatthey would not baptize until they could find a just man for hisgodfather.The father took the child in his arms and went into the street to lookfor this just man. After he had walked along a while, he met a man, whowas our Lord, and said to him, "I have this child to baptize, but I do notwant to give him to anyone who is not just. Are you just?"The Lord answered, "But   I don't know whether I am just."Then the peasant passed on and met a woman, who was the Madonna, andsaid to her, "I have this child to baptize and do not wish to give him toanyone who is not just. Are you just?""I don't know," said the Madonna. "But go on, for you will find someonewho is just."He went his way and met another woman, who was Death, and said to her,"I have been sent to you, for I have been told that you are just, and Ihave this child to baptize, and do not wish to give it to one who is notjust. Are you just?"Death said, "Yes, I believe I am just! Let us baptize the child, andthen I will show you whether I am just."Then they baptized the child, and afterwards Death led the peasant intoa very long room, where there were many lights burning."Godmother," said the man, astonished at seeing all the light, "whatare all these lights?"Death said, "These are the lights of all the souls in the world. Wouldyou like to see, friend? This is yours and this is your son's"When the peasant saw that his light was about to expire, he said, "Andwhen the oil is all consumed, godmother?""Then," answered Death, "you must come with me, for I am Death.""Oh! for mercy's sake," cried the peasant, "let me at least take alittle oil from my son's lamp and put it in mine!""No, no, godfather," said Death. "I don't do anything of that sort. Youwished to see a just person, and a just person you have found. And now gohome and arrange your affairs, for I am waiting for you."
