I have often had this tale told to me by my nurse when a child, and heardthe following version a short time ago in Holderness (Yorkshire), and wasinformed it had been told thus for ages:There was a stepmother who was very unkind to her stepdaughter and verykind to her own daughter. and used to send her stepdaughter to do all thedirty work. One day she sent her to the pump for some water when a littlefrog came up through the sink and asked her not to pour dirty water down,as his drawing room was there. So she did not. and as a reward, he saidpearls and diamonds should drop from her mouth when she spoke.When she returned home it happened as he said. and the stepmother,learning how it had come about, sent her own daughter to the pump. Whenshe got there the little frog spoke to her and asked her not to throwdirty water down, and she replied, "Oh! you nasty, dirty little thing, Iwon't do as you ask me."Then the frog said, "Whenever you speak, frogs, and toads, and snakesshall drop from your mouth."She went home and it happened as the frog had said. At night when theywere sitting at the table a little voice was heard singing outside:Come bring me my supper,My own sweet, sweet one.When the stepdaughter went to the door, there was the little frog. Shebrought him in in spite of her stepmother, took him on her knee, and fedhim with bits from her plate. After a while he sang:Come, let us go to bed,My own sweet, sweet one.So, unknown to her stepmother, she laid him at the foot of her bed, as shesaid he was a poor, harmless thing. Then she fell asleep and forgot allabout him.Next morning there stood a beautiful prince, who said he had beenenchanted by a wicked fairy and was to be a frog till a girl would let himsleep with her. They were married, and lived happily in his beautifulcastle ever after.This is one of the few folk stories I have been able to collect from thelips of a living storyteller in England.
