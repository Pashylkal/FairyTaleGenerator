In the by gone time an old gardener had mounted his son upon an ass andwas proceeding to the garden, himself on foot.They met some men who said, "See this old pederast, how he has mounted theboy upon the ass. and is himself running alongside."Whenever the old man heard this he made the boy alight and mountedhimself.Again they met some other folk, these likewise said, "Look at thisheartless old man, he rides the ass himself and makes the poor child go onfoot."Whenever the old man heard this he took his son up in front of him.Then some people saw them and said, "See this old pederast, how he hastaken the boy up in front of him."The old man heard this, and he put his son up behind him.Again certain folks saw them and said, "See this old catamite, how he hastaken the boy up behind him."The old man knew not what to do, so he put his son down and alightedhimself and drove the ass before them. The garden was near, and both ofthem were on foot, and they reached the garden before meeting with anyothers.
