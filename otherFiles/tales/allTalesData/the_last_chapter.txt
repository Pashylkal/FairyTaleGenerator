All the rest went up the mountain, and separated in groups to the homesof the miners. Curdie and his father and mother took Lootie with them.And the whole way a light, of which all but Lootie understood theorigin, shone upon their path. But when they looked round they couldsee nothing of the silvery globe.For days and days the water continued to rush from the doors andwindows of the king's house, and a few goblin bodies were swept outinto the road.Curdie saw that something must be done. He spoke to his father and therest of the miners, and they at once proceeded to make another outletfor the waters. By setting all hands to the work, tunnelling here andbuilding there, they soon succeeded. and having also made a littletunnel to drain the water away from under the king's house, they weresoon able to get into the wine cellar, where they found a multitude ofdead goblins among the rest the queen, with the skin shoe gone, andthe stone one fast to her ankle for the water had swept away thebarricade, which prevented the men at arms from following the goblins,and had greatly widened the passage. They built it securely up, andthen went back to their labours in the mine.A good many of the goblins with their creatures escaped from theinundation out upon the mountain. But most of them soon left that partof the country, and most of those who remained grew milder incharacter, and indeed became very much like the Scotch brownies. Theirskulls became softer as well as their hearts, and their feet grewharder, and by degrees they became friendly with the inhabitants of themountain and even with the miners. But the latter were merciless toany of the cobs' creatures that came in their way, until at length theyall but disappeared.The rest of the history of The Princess and Curdie must be kept foranother volume.
