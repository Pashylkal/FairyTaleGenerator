Nasreddin Hodja had grown old and was near death. His two grievingwives, knowing that his end was near, were dressed in mourning robes andveils."What is this?" he said, seeing their sorrowful appearance. "Put asideyour veils. Wash your faces. Comb your hair. Make yourselves beautiful.Put on your most festive apparel.""How could we do that?" asked the older of his wives, "with our dearhusband on his deathbed?"With a wry smile he replied, speaking more to himself than to them,"Perhaps when the Angel of Death makes his entry he will see the two ofyou, all decked out like young brides, and will take one of you instead ofme."With these final words he laughed quietly to himself, happily closedhis eyes, and died.
