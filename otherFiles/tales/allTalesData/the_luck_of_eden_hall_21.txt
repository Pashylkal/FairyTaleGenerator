In this house (Eden Hall, a seat of the Musgraves), are some goodold fashioned, apartments. An old painted drinking glass, called theLuck of Eden Hall , is preserved with great care. In the garden nearto the house is a well of excellent spring water, called St. Cuthbert'sWell. (The church is dedicated to that saint.) This glass is supposed tohave been a sacred chalice. but the legendary tale is, that the butler,going to draw water, surprised a company of Fairies, who were amusingthemselves upon the green near the well. he seized the glass which wasstanding upon its margin. They tried to recover it. but, after anineffectual struggle, flew away, saying,If that glass either break or fall,Farewell the luck of Eden Hall.
