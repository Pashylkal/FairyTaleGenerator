During the flood, Old Man was sitting on the highest mountain with allthe beasts. The flood was caused by the above people, because the baby (afungus) of the woman who married a star was heedlessly torn in pieces byan Indian child.Old Man sent the Otter down to get some earth. For a long time hewaited, then the Otter came up dead. Old Man examined its feet, but foundnothing on them. Next he sent Beaver down, but after a long time he alsocame up drowned. Again nothing was found on his feet. He sent Muskrat todive next. Muskrat also was drowned.At length he sent the Duck (?). It was drowned, but in its paw heldsome earth. Old Man saw it, put it in his hand, feigned putting it on thewater three times, and at last dropped it. Then the above people sentrain, and everything grew on the earth.
