One winter's day during a severe storm a horse, an ox, and a dog came andbegged for shelter in the house of a man. Hereadily admitted them, and, as they were cold and wet, he lit a fire fortheir comfort. and he put oats before thehorse, and hay before the ox, while he fed the dog with the remains of hisown dinner. When the storm abated, and theywere about to depart, they determined to show their gratitude in thefollowing way. They divided the life of man amongthem, and each endowed one part of it with the qualities which werepeculiarly his own. The horse took youth, andhence young men are high mettled and impatient of restraint. the ox tookmiddle age, and accordingly men in middlelife are steady and hard working. while the dog took old age, which is thereason why old men are so often peevish andill tempered, and, like dogs, attached chiefly to those who look to theircomfort, while they are disposed to snap atthose who are unfamiliar or distasteful to them.
