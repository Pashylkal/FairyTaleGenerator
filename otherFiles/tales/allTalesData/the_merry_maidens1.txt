Everyone in Cornwall knows the story of the Merry Maidens. It is said thatlong ago some twenty maidens, accompanied by two pipers, were dancing andmaking merry on a Sunday, and as punishment for this sacrilege the lot ofthem were turned to stone: the maidens were petrified in a perfect circlewith the two pipers standing by themselves a little way off.Now I cannot believe this legend, because according to it the stone circlewould come from Christian times, but it has to be much older. WhenI was a lad I heard another explanation for the stones. I cannot rememberany of the details, but I am sure it was much closer to the truth. It hassomething to do with the ley lines that run through here. In fact, a leyline connects the Blind Fiddler standing stone just up the road from herewith my garden. Tomorrow I'll demonstrate its energy for you with adowsing rod.Yes, there is a story about the Blind Fiddler, but I don't remember iteither. However, I do know a story about the Merry Maidens, and it is atrue story.In 1907 an emmet (that's a Cornish word for outsider) from Englandbought the farm where the Merry Maidens stone circle stands. Thinking thatthe stones lessened the value of the field, the new owner ordered one ofhis workers to pull them down and add them to the stone walls surrounding themeadow.The worker, a Cornishman, protested, but the Englishman insisted: "This ismy field, and I'll do with it what I please, and you'll do as I say!"Next day the Cornishman hitched up three shire horses to a chain and beganthe task. (You know shire horses, don't you? They're big one ton drafthorses.)Anyway, while pulling over the first stone the lead horse panicked, rearedup, then fell over dead.Reporting this to his master, the Cornishman asked if he should fetchanother horse for the task."No," said the landowner. "Set the stone back upright. We'll pull the lotof them down later."But the stone circle was left undisturbed, and remains so to this day.
