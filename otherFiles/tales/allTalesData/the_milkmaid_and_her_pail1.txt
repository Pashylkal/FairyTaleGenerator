A farmer's daughter had been out to milk the cows, and was returning tothe dairy carrying her pail of milk upon her head. As she walked along,she fell a musing after this fashion:The milk in this pail will provide me with cream, which I willmake into butter and take to market to sell. With the money I will buy anumber of eggs, and these, when hatched, will produce chickens, and by andby I shall have quite a large poultry yard. Then I shall sell some of myfowls, and with the money which they will bring in I will buy myself a newgown, which I shall wear when I go to the fair. and all the young fellowswill admire it, and come and make love to me, but I shall toss my head andhave nothing to say to them.Forgetting all about the pail, and suiting the action to the word, shetossed her head. Down went the pail, all the milk was spilled, and allher fine castles in the air vanished in a moment!Moral:Do not count your chickens before they arehatched.
