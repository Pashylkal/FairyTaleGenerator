The ourisk of the Celts was a creature by no means peculiarly malevolentor formidably powerful, but rather a melancholy spirit, which dwelt inwildernesses far removed from men. If we are to identify him with theBrown Dwarf of the Border moors, the ourisk has a mortal term of life anda hope of salvation, as indeed the same high claim was made by the satyrwho appeared to St. Anthony. Moreover, the Highland ourisk was a speciesof lubber fiend, and capable of being over reached by those who understoodphilology.It is related of one of these goblins which frequented a mill near thefoot of Loch Lomond, that the miller, desiring to get rid of this meddlingspirit, who injured the machinery by setting the water on the wheel whenthere was no grain to be grinded, contrived to have a meeting with thegoblin by watching in his mill till night. The ourisk then entered, anddemanded the miller's name, and was informed that he was calledMyself . on which is founded a story almost exactly like that ofOutis in The Odyssey , a tale which, though classic, is by nomeans an elegant or ingenious fiction, but which we are astonished to findin an obscure district, and in the Celtic tongue, seeming to argue someconnection or communication between these remote Highlands of Scotland andthe readers of Homer in former days, which we cannot account for. Afterall, perhaps, some churchman more learned than his brethren may havetransferred the legend from Sicily to Duncrune, from the shores of theMediterranean to those of Loch Lomond.
