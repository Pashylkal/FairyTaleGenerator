Once upon a time, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisattacame to life at the foot of the Himalayas as a monkey. He grew strong andsturdy, big of frame, well to do, and lived by a curve of the river Gangesin a forest haunt. Now at that time there was a crocodile dwelling in theGanges. The crocodile's mate saw the great frame of the monkey, and sheconceived a longing to eat his heart. So she said to her lord, "Sir, Idesire to eat the heart of that great king of the monkeys!""Good wife," said the crocodile, "I live in the water and he lives ondry land. How can we catch him?""By hook or by crook," she replied, "he must be caught. If I don't gethim, I shall die.""All right," answered the crocodile, consoling her, "don't troubleyourself. I have a plan. I will give you his heart to eat."So when the Bodhisatta was sitting on the bank of the Ganges, aftertaking a drink of water, the crocodile drew near, and said, "Sir Monkey,why do you live on bad fruits in this old familiar place? On the otherside of the Ganges there is no end to the mango trees, and labuja trees,with fruit sweet as honey! Is it not better to cross over and have allkinds of wild fruit to eat?""Lord Crocodile," the monkey answered. "The Ganges is deep and wide.How shall I get across?""If you want to go, I will let you sit upon my back, and carry youover."The monkey trusted him, and agreed. "Come here, then," said thecrocodile. "Up on my back with you!" and up the monkey climbed. But whenthe crocodile had swum a little way, he plunged the monkey under thewater."Good friend, you are letting me sink!" cried the monkey. "What is thatfor?"The crocodile said, "You think I am carrying you out of pure goodnature? Not a bit of it! My wife has a longing for your heart, and I wantto give it to her to eat.!""Friend," said the monkey, "it is nice of you to tell me. Why, if ourheart were inside us, when we go jumping among the tree tops it would beall knocked to pieces!""Well, where do you keep it?" asked the crocodile.The Bodhisatta pointed out a fig tree, with clusters of ripe fruit,standing not far off. "See," said he, "there are our hearts hanging onyonder fig tree.""If you will show me your heart," said the crocodile, "then I won'tkill you.""Take me to the tree, then, and I will point it out to you."The crocodile brought him to the place. The monkey leapt off his back,and, climbing up the fig tree, sat upon it. "Oh silly crocodile!" said he."You thought that there were creatures that kept their hearts in atreetop! You are a fool, and I have outwitted you! You may keep your fruitto yourself. Your body is great, but you have no sense."And then to explain this idea he uttered the following stanzas:Rose apple, jack fruit, mangoes, too, across the water there Isee.Enough of them, I want them not. my fig is good enough for me!Great is your body, verily, but how much smaller is your wit!Now go your ways, Sir Crocodile, for I have had the best of it.The crocodile, feeling as sad and miserable as if he had lost athousand pieces of money, went back sorrowing to the place where helived.
