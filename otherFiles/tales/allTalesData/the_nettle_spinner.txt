ONCE upon a time there lived at Quesnoy, in Flanders, a great lord whosename was Burchard, but whom the country people called Burchard the Wolf.Now Burchard had such a wicked, cruel heart, that it was whispered howhe used to harness his peasants to the plough, and force them by blowsfrom his whip to till his land with naked feet.His wife, on the other hand, was always tender and pitiful to the poorand miserable.Every time that she heard of another misdeed of her husband's shesecretly went to repair the evil, which caused her name to be blessedthroughout the whole country side. This Countess was adored as much asthe Count was hated.
