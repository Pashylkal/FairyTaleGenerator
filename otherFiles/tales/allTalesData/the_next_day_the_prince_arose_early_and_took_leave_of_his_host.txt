'The wood that you saw in your dream is not far from here,' said theold man. 'It is in the depth of the forest, and this road will lead youthere. You will come to a vast park surrounded by high walls. In themiddle of the park is a castle, where dwells a horrible witch who allowsno living being to enter the doors. Behind the castle is the orangegrove. Follow the wall till you come to a heavy iron gate. Don't try topress it open, but oil the hinges with this,' and the old man gave him asmall bottle.'The gate will open of itself,' he continued, 'and a huge dog whichguards the castle will come to you with his mouth wide open, but justthrow him this oat cake. Next, you will see a baking woman leaning overher heated oven. Give her this brush. Lastly, you will find a well onyour left. do not forget to take the cord of the bucket and spread it inthe sun. When you have done this, do not enter the castle, but go roundit and enter the orange grove. Then gather three oranges, and get backto the gate as fast as you can. Once out of the gate, leave the forestby the opposite side.'Now, attend to this: whatever happens, do not open your oranges tillyou reach the bank of a river, or a fountain. Out of each orange willcome a princess, and you can choose which you like for your wife. Yourchoice once made, be very careful never to leave your bride for aninstant, and remember that the danger which is most to be feared isnever the danger we are most afraid of.'
