My father and mother were IrishAnd I am Irish too.I bought a wee fidil for ninepenceAnd that is Irish too.I'm up in the morning earlyTo meet the break of day,And to the lintwhite's pipingThe many's the tunes I play!One pleasant eve in June timeI met a lochrie man,His face and hands were weazen,His height was not a span.He boor'd me for my fidil "You know," says he, "like you,"My father and mother were Irish,"And I am Irish too!"He took my wee red fidil,And such a tune he turned,The Glaise in it whisperedThe Lionan in it m'urned.Says he, "My lad, you're lucky,"I wisht I was like you,"You're lucky in your birth star,"And in your fidil too!"He gave me back my fidil,My fidil stick also,And stepping like a May boy,He jumped the Lear gaidh knowe.I never saw him after,Nor met his gentle kind,But whiles I think I hear him,A wheening in the wind!JOSEPH CAMPBELL.
