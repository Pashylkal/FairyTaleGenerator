Once upon a time there was an old man who could hardly walk. His kneesshook. He could not hear or see very well, and he did not have any teethleft. When he sat at the table, he could scarcely hold a spoon. He spilledsoup on the tablecloth, and, beside that, some of his soup would run backout of his mouth. His son and his son's wife were disgusted with this, sofinally they made the old grandfather sit in the corner behind the stove,where they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not enough atthat. He sat there looking sadly at the table, and his eyes grew moist.One day his shaking hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to theground and broke. The young woman scolded, but he said not a word. He onlysobbed. Then for a few hellers they bought him a wooden bowl and made himeat from it. Once when they were all sitting there, the little grandson offour years pushed some pieces of wood together on the floor."What are you making?" asked his father."Oh, I'm making a little trough for you and mother to eat from when I'mbig."The man and the woman looked at one another and then began to cry. Theyimmediately brought the old grandfather to the table, and always let himeat there from then on. And if he spilled a little, they did not say athing.
