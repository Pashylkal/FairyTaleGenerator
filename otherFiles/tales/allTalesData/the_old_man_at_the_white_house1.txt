There was once a man who lived in a white house in a certain village, andhe knew everything about everybody that lived in the place.In the same village there lived a woman who had a daughter called Sally,and one day she gave Sally a pair of yellow kid gloves and threatened tokill her if she lost them. Now Sally was very proud of her gloves, but shewas careless enough to lose one of them. After she had lost it she went toa row of houses in the village and inquired at every door if they had seenher glove. But everybody said "No." and she was told to go and ask the oldman that lived in the white house.So Sally went to the white house and asked the old man if he had seen herglove.The old man said, "I have thy glove, and I will give it thee if thou wiltpromise me to tell nobody where thou hast found it. And remember if thoutells anybody I shall fetch thee out of bed when the clock strikes twelveat night."So he gave the glove back to Sally.But Sally's mother got to know about her losing the glove, and said,"Where did thou find it?"Sally said, "I daren't tell, for if I do an old man will fetch me out ofbed at twelve o'clock at night."Her mother said, "I will bar all the doors and fasten all the windows, andthen he can't get in and fetch thee." and then she made Sally tell herwhere she had found her glove.So Sally's mother barred all the doors and fastened all the windows, andSally went to bed at ten o'clock that night and began to cry. At elevenshe began to cry louder, and at twelve o'clock she heard a voice saying ina whisper, but gradually getting louder and louder:"Sally, I'm up one step.""Sally, I'm up two steps.""Sally, I'm up three steps.""Sally, I'm up four steps.""Sally, I'm up five steps.""Sally, I'm up six steps.""Sally, I'm up seven steps.""Sally, I'm up eight steps.""Sally, I'm up nine steps.""Sally, I'm up ten steps.""Sally, I'm up eleven steps.""Sally, I'm up twelve steps!""Sally, I'm at thy bedroom door!!""Sally, I have hold of thee!!!"
