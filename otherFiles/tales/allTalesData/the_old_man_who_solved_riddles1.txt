The custom in olden times was to take the old men to the mountain,where they were left to die of hunger or to be torn to pieces by wildbeasts. This was done to prevent famine and starvation, and those childrenwho did not do it were killed by the people.A young man was taking his father to the mountain when he started tocry. The son took pity on him and took him home and locked him up in thecellar.There came an order from the emperor to the villager to kill a she bearwhich appeared above the village. The young man asked his father in thecellar what was the meaning of this order, and he answered, "It means therock at the top of the hill."The young man went to the assembly of the villagers and told them theanswer to the emperor's order. They were to say, "We will kill theshe bear, and we will wait for the emperor to come and flay her."On another occasion the emperor wanted them to bring him every kind ofseed found in the neighborhood. The old man in the cellar told the youngman to go to an anthill, there they would be sure to find them all.When the young man again repeated this advice to the men in the villageassembly, they were all surprised at his cleverness, and asked him to tellthem who it was that had given him such advice, for they knew that he musthave learned it from someone else.He then told them what he had done. Since then they no longer kill theold men, because their wisdom is indispensable.
