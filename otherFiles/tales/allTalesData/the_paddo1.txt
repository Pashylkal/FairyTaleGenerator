A poor widow was one day baking bannocks, and sent her dochter wi' a dishto the well to bring water. The dochter gaed, and better gaed, till shecame to the well, but it was dry. Now, what to do she didna ken, for shecouldna gang back to her mother without water. sae she sat down by theside o' the well, and fell a greeting. A paddo (frog) then cameloup loup louping out o' the well, and asked the lassie what she wasgreeting for. and she said she was greeting because there was nae water inthe well."But," says the paddo, "an ye'll be my wife, I'll gie ye plenty o' water."And the lassie, no thinking that the poor beast could mean anythingserious, said she wad be his wife, for the sake o' getting the water. Soshe got the water into her dish, and gaed away hame to her mother, andthought nae mair about the paddo, till that night, when, just as she andher mother were about to go their beds, something came to the door, andwhen they listened, they heard this sang:O open the door, my hinnie, my heart,O open the door, my ain true love.Remember the promise that you and I made,down i' the meadow, where we twa met.Says the mother to the dochter, "What noise is that at the door?""Hout," says the dochter, "it's naething but a filthy paddo.""Open the door," says the mother, "to the poor paddo." So the lassieopened the door, and the paddo came loup loup louping in, and sat down bythe ingle side. Then he sings:O gie me my supper, my hinnie, my heart,O gie me my supper, my ain true love.Remember the promise that you and I made,Down i' the meadow, where we twa met."Hout," quo' the dochter, 'wad I gie a filthy paddo his supper?""O ay," said the mother, "e'n gie the poor paddo his supper."So the paddo got his supper. and after that he sings again:O put me to bed, my hinnie, my heart,O put me to bed, my ain true love.Remember the promise that you and I made,Down i' the meadow, where we twa met."Hout," quo' the dochter, "wad I put a filthy paddo to bed?""O ay," says the mother, "put the poor paddo to bed." And so she put thepaddo to his bed. (Here let us abridge a little.)Then the paddo sang again:Now fetch me an axe, my hinnie, my heart,Now fetch me an axe, my ain true love.Remember the promise that you and I made,Down i' the meadow, where we twa met.Well, the lassie chappit aff his head. and no sooner was that done, thanhe started up the bonniest young prince that ever was seen. And the twalived happy a' the rest o' their days.
