More than two hundred years ago, it was on April 15, 1614, that ahorrible murder was committed in the old part of Salzwedel just off thestreet leading to Saint Ann's Convent, that formerly stood there.A merchant's servant by the name of Dietrich Schulze stabbed his fatherand his mother to death. He stabbed the father four times, and when themother came to the father's aid, he stabbed her three times.He was sentenced to die, and the sentence was carried out on the fourthof May of the same year. First his right hand, with which he hadcommitted the horrible deed, was cut off. Then he was tortured threetimes with red hot pincers, first in the marketplace, second in front ofthe house where the murder was committed, and finally in the toweritself.Then he was dragged to the place of execution and placed on the wheelupside down, half sitting and half lying. It was miraculous and horribleto see how the hand with which he had committed this terrible deedcontinued to bleed for three days on the wheel.
