A peasant once went to the gardener's, to steal cucumbers. He crept up tothe cucumbers, and thought, "I will carry off a bag of cucumbers, which Iwill sell. with the money I will buy a hen. The hen will lay eggs, hatchthem, and raise a lot of chicks. I will feed the chicks and sell them.then I will buy me a young sow, and she will bear a lot of pigs. I willsell the pigs, and buy me a mare. the mare will foal me some colts. I willraise the colts, and sell them. I will buy me a house, and start a garden.In the garden I will sow cucumbers, and will not let them be stolen, butwill keep a sharp watch on them. I will hire watchmen, and put them in thecucumber patch, while I myself will come on them, unawares, and shout,'Oh, there, keep a sharp lookout!'"And this he shouted as loud as he could. The watchmen heard it, and theyrushed out and beat the peasant.
