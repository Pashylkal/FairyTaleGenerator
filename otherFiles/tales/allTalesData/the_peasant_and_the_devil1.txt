Once upon a time there was a clever, wily peasant, whosetricks could be much talked about. The best story, however, is how he oncegotthe best of the devil and made a fool of him. One day the peasant had beenworking in his field, and just as it was getting dark he was getting readytogo home when in the middle of his field he saw a pile of burning coals.Filledwith amazement he walked toward it, and sitting on the top of the glowingcoalsthere was a little black devil."You must be sitting on a treasure," said the peasant."Yes indeed," replied the devil, "on a treasure that containsmore gold and silver than you have ever seen in your life.""The treasure is in my field and belongs to me," said the peasant."It is yours," answered the devil, "if for two years you willgive me one half of everything your field produces. I have enough money,but Ihave a desire for the fruits of the earth."The peasant entered into the bargain, saying, "To prevent any disputefrom arising about the division, everything above the ground shall belongtoyou, and everything beneath the ground to me."The devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant hadplantedturnips.Now when harvest time came the devil appeared and wanted to take awayhiscrop, but he found nothing except the yellow withered leaves, and thehappypeasant dug up his turnips."You got the best of me this time," said the devil, "but itwon't happen again. Next time what grows above ground shall be yours, andwhatis under it shall be mine.""That is all right with me," answered the peasant. When plantingtime came the peasant did not plant turnips again, but wheat. The cropripened,and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks off at groundlevel. When the devil came he found nothing but the stubble, and heangrilydisappeared into a chasm in a cliff."That's the way one has to deal with foxes," said the peasant,then carried away the treasure.
