Constant tradition says that there lived in former times in Soffham(Swaffham), alias Sopham, in Norfolk, a certain peddler, who dreamed thatif he went to London Bridge, and stood there, he should hear very joyfulnews, which he at first slighted, but afterwards, his dream being doubledand trebled upon him, he resolved to try the issue of it, and accordinglywent to London, and stood on the bridge there two or three days, lookingabout him, but heard nothing that might yield him any comfort.At last it happened that a shopkeeper there, hard by, having noted hisfruitless standing, seeing that he neither sold any wares nor asked anyalms, went to him and most earnestly begged to know what he wanted there,or what his business was. to which the peddler honestly answered that hehad dreamed that if he came to London and stood there upon the bridge heshould hear good news. at which the shopkeeper laughed heartily, askinghim if he was such a fool as to take a journey on such a silly errand,adding, "I'll tell you, country fellow, last night I dreamed that I was atSopham, in Norfolk, a place utterly unknown to me where I thought thatbehind a peddler's house in a certain orchard, and under a great oak tree,if I dug I should find a vast treasure! Now think you," says he, "that Iam such a fool to take such a long journey upon me upon the instigation ofa silly dream? No, no. I'm wiser. Therefore, good fellow, learn wit fromme, and get you home, and mind your business."The peddler observing his words, what he had said he dreamed, andknowing they concerned him, glad of such joyful news, went speedily home,and dug and found a prodigious great treasure, with which he grewexceeding rich. and Soffham (Church) being for the most part fallen down,he set on workmen and rectified it most sumptuously, at his own charges.and to this day there is his statue therein, but in stone, with his packat his back and his dog at his heels. and his memory is also preserved bythe same form or picture in most of the old glass windows, taverns, andalehouses of that town unto this day.
