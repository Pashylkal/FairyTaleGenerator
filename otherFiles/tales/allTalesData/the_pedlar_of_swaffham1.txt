Constant tradition says that there lived in former times in Soffham(Swaffham), alias Sopham, in Norfolk, a certain pedlar, who dreamed thatif he went to London Bridge, and stood there, he should hear very joyfulnews, which he at first slighted, but afterwards, his dream being doubledand trebled upon him, he resolved to try the issue of it, and accordinglywent to London, and stood on the bridge there two or three days, lookingabout him, but heard nothing that might yield him any comfort.At last it happened that a shopkeeper there, hard by, having noted hisfruitless standing, seeing that he neither sold any wares nor asked anyalms, went to him and most earnestly begged to know what he wanted there,or what his business was. to which the pedlar honestly answered that hehad dreamed that if he came to London and stood there upon the bridge heshould hear good news. at which the shopkeeper laughed heartily, askinghim if he was such a fool as to take a journey on such a silly errand,adding, "I'll tell you, country fellow, last night I dreamed that I wasat Sopham, in Norfolk, a place utterly unknown to me where I thought thatbehind a pedlar's house in a certain orchard, and under a great oaktree, if I dug I should find a vast treasure! Now think you," says he,"that I am such a fool to take such a long journey upon me upon theinstigation of a silly dream? No, no. I'm wiser. Therefore, goodfellow, learn wit from me, and get you home, and mind your business."The pedlar observing his words, what he had said he dreamed, and knowingthey concerned him, glad of such joyful news, went speedily home, and dugand found a prodigious great treasure, with which he grew exceeding rich.and Soffham (Church) being for the most part fallen down, he set onworkmen and rectified it most sumptuously, at his own charges. and tothis day there is his statue therein, but in stone, with his pack at hisback and his dog at his heels. and his memory is also preserved by thesame form or picture in most of the old glass windows, taverns, andalehouses of that town unto this day.
