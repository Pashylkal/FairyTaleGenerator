There was once a poor man, who lived in a house next to a wealthymerchant who sold oil and honey. As the merchant was a kind neighbor, heone day sent a flask of oil to the poor man. The poor man was delighted,and put it carefully away on the top shelf.One evening, as he was gazing at it, he said half aloud, "I wonder howmuch oil there is in that bottle. There is a large quantity. If I shouldsell it, I could buy five sheep. Every year I should have lambs, andbefore long I should own a flock. Then I should sell some of the sheep,and be rich enough to marry a wife. Perhaps we might have a son. Andwhat a fine boy he would be! So tall, strong, and obedient! But if heshould disobey me," and he raised the staff which he held in his hand, "Ishould punish him thus!"And he swung the staff over his head and brought it heavily to theground, knocking, as he did so, the flask off the shelf so that the oilran over him from head to foot.
