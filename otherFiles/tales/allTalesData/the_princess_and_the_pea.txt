Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry aprincess. but she would have to be a real princess. He travelled allover the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted.There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whetherthey were real ones. There was always something about them that wasnot as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he wouldhave liked very much to have a real princess.One evening a terrible storm came on. there was thunder andlightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knockingwas heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But,good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look.The water ran down from her hair and clothes. it ran down into thetoes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said thatshe was a real princess."Well, we'll soon find that out," thought the old queen. But shesaid nothing, went into the bed room, took all the bedding off thebedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom. then she took twentymattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider down bedson top of the mattresses.On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning shewas asked how she had slept."Oh, very badly!" said she. "I have scarcely closed my eyes allnight. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying onsomething hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It'shorrible!"Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had feltthe pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twentyeider down beds.Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had areal princess. and the pea was put in the museum, where it may stillbe seen, if no one has stolen it.There, that is a true story.
