In long past times a hunter wounded an elephant with a poisoned arrow.Perceiving that he had hit it, he followed after the arrow and killed theelephant. Five hundred robbers who had plundered a hill town were led byan evil star to that spot, where they perceived the elephant. As it wasjust then a time of hunger with them, they said, "Now that we have foundthis meat, let two hundred and fifty of us cut the flesh off the elephantand roast it, while two hundred and fifty go to fetch water."Then those among them who had cut the flesh off the elephant and cookedit, said among themselves, "Honored sirs, now that we have accomplishedsuch a task and collected so much stolen property, wherefore should wegive away part of it to the others?" Let us eat as much of the meat as weplease, and then poison the rest. The others will eat the poisoned meatand die, and then the stolen goods will be ours."So after they had eaten their fill of the meat, they poisoned whatremained over. Those who had gone to fetch water, likewise, when they haddrunk as much water as they wanted, poisoned what was left. So when theycame back, and those who had eaten the flesh drank the water, and thosewho had drunk the water ate the flesh, they all of them died.Now there came to that spot a jackal, fettered by the ties of time, andit saw all those dead bodies. With a joy that sprang from greediness itthought, "As an extremely large amount of booty as accrued to me, I willtake each part of it in its turn." So it seized the bow with its jaws, andbegan to gnaw at the knots of the bowstring. The string snapped, and theend of the bow struck the jackal in the roof of the mouth so hard, that itdied. The jackal uttered this proverb: "It is good to accumulate, but notto accumulate immoderately. See how the jackal, infatuated by greed afterthe accumulated, was killed by the bow."
