The ratcatcher knows a particular tone, which he sounds nine times onhis fife, and then all rats follow after him, wherever he wants them togo, into a pond or a pool.Once a village could not be rid of its rats, and finally they sent forthe ratcatcher. He prepared a hazel stick in such a manner that all ratswere drawn toward it. They would then have to follow anyone who took holdof the stick. Waiting until a Sunday, he laid it in front of the churchdoor. As the people were going home after the worship service, a millercame by, saw the good looking stick lying there and said, "That will makea fine walking stick for me." He picked it up and left the village,walking toward his mill.Meanwhile a number of rats began to leave their cracks and corners andcame running and jumping across the fields toward him. The miller, stillcarrying the stick, had no idea what was happening. When he came to ameadow, they ran from their holes and ran across the fields and pasturesafter him. Running ahead, they were inside his house before he himselfwas, and they stayed there as a plague that could not be overcome.
