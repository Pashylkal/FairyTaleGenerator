It is very noteworthy that there are no rats at all in the city ofNeustadt Eberswalde. The explanation is as follows:In earlier times there were a great many rats there, especially in thetown's grain mill, where they caused much damage. In about the year 1607or 1608 a certain man presented himself to the council and offered to getrid of these vermin, claiming that no rats would return to the mill aslong as it should stand. He did not ask for even the slightest paymentuntil one year after he had done away with the rats. At that time hischarge would be ten thalers, which was promised to him. The magistrate hadhim paid two thalers in advance.The man then placed something in the mill and something else in asecret place. The following day the people saw with amazement how the ratsleft the mill in a great swarm and swam out into the Finow River, thatflows by there. Not a single rat was left behind.A year later the man returned to collect the eight thalers that werestill owed him, and he was paid. From that time forth no trace of a rathas been seen there, neither in the mill, nor in the city.
