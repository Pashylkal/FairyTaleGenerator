"Write it on a piece ofpaper for me."The friend obliged him, and the Hodja continued on his way, the pieceof meat in one hand and the recipe in the other. He had not walked farwhen suddenly a large hawk swooped down from the sky, snatched the meat,and flew away with it."It will do you no good!" shouted the Hodja after the disappearinghawk. "I still have the recipe!"
