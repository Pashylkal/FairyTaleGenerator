Two women in Jetzschko were baking a pancake, and when it was almostdone they began to quarrel, because each one wanted the whole thing.The one woman said, "I get the pancake!"The other one replied, "No, I want all of it!"Before they knew what was happening, the pancake suddenly grew feet,jumped out of the pan, and ran away.He came to a fox, who said to him, "Pancake, pancake, where are yougoing?"The pancake answered, "I ran away from two old women, and I shall runaway from you as well!"Then he met a hare. It too shouted, "Pancake, pancake, where are yougoing?"The pancake answered, "I ran away from two old women, Reynard the Fox,and I shall run away from you as well.The pancake ran on until he came to some water. A ship full of peoplewas floating on the water. They too cried out to him, "Pancake, pancake,where are you going?"Again he said, "I ran away from two old women, Reynard the Fox, Speedythe Hare, and I shall run away from you as well."Then he came to a large pig. It too shouted to him, "Pancake, pancake,where are you going?""Oh," he said, "I ran away from two old women, Reynard the Fox, Speedythe Hare, a ship full of people, and I shall run away from you aswell."The pig said, "Pancake, I am hard of hearing. You'll have to say itinto my ear!"So the pancake went up close, and bam! bam! the pig snatched him andate him up, and with that the story is ended.
