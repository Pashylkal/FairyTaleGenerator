A scorpion and a tortoise became such fast friends that they took a vowthat they would never separate. So when it happened that one of them wasobliged to leave his native land, the other promised to go with him. Theyhad traveled only a short distance when they came to a wide river. Thescorpion was now greatly troubled."Alas," he said, "you, my friend, can easily swim, but how can a poorscorpion like me ever get across this stream?""Never fear," replied the tortoise. "only place yourself squarely on mybroad back and I will carry you safely over."No sooner was the scorpion settled on the tortoise's broad back, thanthe tortoise crawled into the water and began to swim. Halfway across hewas startled by a strange rapping on his back, which made him ask thescorpion what he was doing."Doing?" answered the scorpion. "I am whetting my sting to see if itis possible to pierce your hard shell.""Ungrateful friend," responded the tortoise, "it is well that I have itin my power both to save myself and to punish you as you deserve." Andstraightway he sank his back below the surface and shook off the scorpioninto the water.
