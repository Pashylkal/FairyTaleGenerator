A lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death at themouth of his cave, gasping for breath. Theanimals, his subjects, came round him and drew nearer as he grew more andmore helpless. When they saw him on thepoint of death they thought to themselves, "Now is the time to pay off oldgrudges." So the boar came up and drove athim with his tusks. then a bull gored him with his horns. still the lionlay helpless before them: so the ass, feelingquite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to the lion kickedup his heels into his face. "This is a doubledeath," growled the lion.Moral: Only cowards insult dying majesty.
