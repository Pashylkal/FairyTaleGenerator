A stag, whose joints had become stiff with old age, was at great pains toget together a large heap of fodder  enough, as he thought, to last him for the remainder of his days. Hestretched himself out upon it, and, now dozing,now nibbling, made up his mind to wait quietly for the end.He had always been of a gay and lively turn, and had made in his time manyfriends. These now came in great numbers tosee him and wish him farewell. While engaged in friendly talk over pastadventures and old times, what more naturalthan that they should help themselves to a little of the food which seemedso plentifully stored around? The end ofthe matter was, that the poor stag died not so much of sickness or of oldage as for sheer want of the food which hisfriends had eaten for him.Moral: Thoughtless friends bring more hurt than profit.
