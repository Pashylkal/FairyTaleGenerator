There dips the rocky highlandOf Sleuth Wood in the lake,There lies a leafy island,Where flapping herons wakeThe drowsy water rats.There we've hid our faery vats,Full of berries,And of reddest stolen cherries.Come away, O human child!To the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand,For the world's more full of weeping thanyou can understand.Where the wave of moonlight glossesThe dim gray sands with light,Far off by furthest RossesWe foot it all the night,Weaving olden dances,Mingling hands and mingling glances,Till the moon has taken flight.To and fro we leapAnd chase the frothy bubbles,While the world is full of troublesAnd is anxious in its sleep.Come away, O human child!To the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand,For the world's more full of weeping thanyou can understand.Where the wandering water gushesFrom the hills above Glen Car,In pools among the rushesThat scarce could bathe a star,We seek for slumbering trout,And whispering in their earsGive them unquiet dreams.Leaning softly outFrom ferns that drop their tearsOver the young streams.Come away, O human child!To the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand,For the world's more full of weeping thanyou can understand.Away with us he's going,The solemn eyed:He'll hear no more the lowingOf the calves on the warm hillside.Or the kettle on the hobSing peace into his breast,Or see the brown mice bobRound and round the oatmeal chest.For he comes, the human child!To the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand,From a world more full of weeping thanhe can understand.W.
