In the very beginning there lived a being so large that he cannot becompared with any known thing. His name was Melu, and when he sat on theclouds, which were his home, he occupied all the space above. His teethwere pure gold, and because he was very cleanly and continually rubbedhimself with his hands, his skin became pure white. The dead skin which herubbed off his body was placed on one side in a pile, and by and by thispile became so large that he was annoyed and set himself to consider whathe could do with it.Finally Melu decided to make the earth. so he worked very hard in puttingthe dead skin into shape, and when it was finished he was so pleased withit that he determined to make two beings like himself, though smaller, tolive on it.Taking the remnants of the material left after making the earth hefashioned two men, but just as they were all finished except their noses,Tau Tana from below the earth appeared and wanted to help him.Melu did not wish any assistance, and a great argument ensued. Tau Tanafinally won his point and made the noses which he placed on the peopleupside down. When all was finished, Melu and Tau Tana whipped the formsuntil they moved. Then Melu went to his home above the clouds, and TauTana returned to his place below the earth.All went well until one day a great rain came, and the people on the earthnearly drowned from the water which ran off their heads into their noses.Melu, from his place on the clouds, saw their danger, and he came quicklyto earth and saved their lives by turning their noses the other side up.The people were very grateful to him, and promised to do anything heshould ask of them. Before he left for the sky, they told him that theywere very unhappy living on the great earth all alone, so he told them tosave all the hair from their heads and the dry skin from their bodies andthe next time he came he would make them some companions. And in this waythere came to be a great many people on the earth.
