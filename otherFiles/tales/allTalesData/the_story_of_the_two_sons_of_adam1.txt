Recite to them the story of the two sons of Adam.truly when they offered an offering, and it was accepted from one of them,and was not accepted from the other, that one said, "I will surely killthee." he said, "God only accepts from those who fear. If thou dost stretch forthto me thine hand to kill me, I will not stretch forth mine hand to killthee. verily, I fear God, the Lord of the worlds. verily, I wish that thoumayest draw upon thee my sin and thy sin, and be of the fellows of theFire, for that is the reward of the unjust."But his soul allowed him to slay his brother, and he slew him, and in themorning he was of those who lose. And God sent a crow to scratch in theearth and show him how he might hide his brother's shame, he said, "Alas, for me! Am I too helpless to become like this crow and hide my brother's shame?" and in the morning he was of those who did repent.
