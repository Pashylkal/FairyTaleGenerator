There was a shepherd once who went out to the hill to look after hissheep. It was misty and cold, and he had much trouble to find them. Atlast he had them all but one. and after much searching he found that onetoo in a peat hag (bog) half drowned. So he took off his plaid, and bentdown and took hold of the sheep's tail, and he pulled! The sheep was heavywith water, and he could not lift her, so he took off his coat, and hepulled!! But it was too much for him, and he spit on his hands, andtook a good hold of the tail and he PULLED!! And the tail broke! And if ithad not been for that, this tale would have been a great deal longer.
