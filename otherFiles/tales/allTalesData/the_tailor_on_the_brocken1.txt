A tailor heard that during the night between the last of April and thefirst of May witches gather on Glocker Mountain and there performincredible dances. Being curious, on the preceding day he set forth andclimbed Glocker Mountain. He hid himself among the branches of a willowtree and then saw how many hundred witches flew there through the air, hada lovely feast, and then danced joyfully.One of the witches noticed him and shouted to another one, "See what alarge burl that willow branch has. I'm going to drive my ax into it, so Ican find it again next year." And she drove her ax into his back.He only felt a single stab, but from that moment onward his back was veryheavy, and when the sun came up he saw with terror from his shadow that hewas now a hunchback.Nevertheless, the following year when the first of May was approaching hecould not restrain his desire to return to Glocker Mountain, because thedances had pleased him so much. Seated once again in the willow tree, thewitch saw him, as before, and said, "I want to pull my ax out of thewillow burl, so I won't lose it."She reached for his back, and he felt a light stab. From that time onwardhis hump was gone. When the witch pulled her hand back, she was holding anax.
