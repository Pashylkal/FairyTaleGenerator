A water snail was coming upstream from the lower reaches, when a king crowheard it. Said the king crow to himself, "Who can it be coming upstream,that exclaims so loudly at the rapids? One might say it was a man, butthat there is nothing to be seen."So the king crow settled on a tree to watch, but as he could see nothingfrom his perch on the tree he flew down to the ground, and walked along bythe waterside. And when he thought to see some man exclaiming, he caughtsight of the water snail."Hullo, you there," said he, "where do you come from?""I come from the eddy below the rapids," said the water snail, "and I onlywant to get as far as the headwaters of this river."Said the king crow, "Wait a bit. Suppose you go down to the river mouth asquickly as you can, and we will have a wager on it." (Now rivers are thewater snail's domain, in which he has many comrades.)"What is to be the stake?" asked the water snail."If I am beaten I will be your slave, and look after your aroids and wildcaladiums (on which the water snails feed). Then the king crow asked, "Andwhat will you stake?"The water snail replied, "If I am beaten the river shall be handed over toyou, and you shall be king of the river."But the water snail begged for a delay of twice seven days, saying that hefelt knocked up after ascending the rapids. And the delay was grantedaccordingly.Meanwhile however the water snail hunted up a great number of his friendsand instructed them to conceal themselves in each of the higher reaches ofthe river, and to reply immediately when the king crow challenged them.The day arrived, and the king crow flew off, and in each of the higherreaches the water snail's friends replied to the challenge. And at theriver mouth the water snail replied in person. So the king crow wasdefeated and has ever since remained the slave of the water snail.
