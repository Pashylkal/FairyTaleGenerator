(A Ballad Exemplifying the Longevity of that Famous Town 200 Years Ago.)Oh! Painswick is a healthful town.It hath a bracing breeze,Where men by nature's rules might liveAs long as e'er they please.Before the glass and baneful pipeHad robb'd man of his strength,And water only was his drink,He lived a greater length.Two hundred years, or more, agoA pilgrim passed that way.And what that pilgrim heard and sawI will relate today.And while he stopp'd outside the townTo rest his weary bones.He saw a very aged manUpon a heap of stones.The pilgrim saw him with surprise,And surely thought he dream'd.The poor man was so very old,Methuselah he seem'd!He'd travelled o'er the wide, wide world.Amid its heat and cold,But he had never, never seenA man one half so old.His face was wrinkled like a skinThat's shrivell'd by the heat.His hair was whiter than the snowWe tread beneath our feet.It made the pilgrim very sad.As he was passing by,To see his old eyes fill'd with tears.To hear him sob and cry.The man was crying like a child,His tears fell like the rain.The pilgrim felt for him, and ask'd,"Old man, are you in pain?"Oh, tell me, tell me, poor old man,Why do you sob and cry?"The old man rubb'd his eyes, and said,"Feethur's bin a byutting I!""Old man, old man, you must be mad.For that can never be.Your father surely has been deadAt least a century.""My feethur be alive and well,I wish that he weer dy'ud.For he ha bin and byut his stickAbout my face and yud."The pilgrim pick'd the old man up.And walk'd to Painswick town."Oh show me where your father lives.And I will put you down.And I will tell the cruel manSuch things must not be done,And I will say how wrong it isTo beat his aged son."The pilgrim shook a garden gate.An old man ope'd the door.His back was bended like a bow,His white beard swept the floor.If Adam he had lived till now,And lengthen'd out his span,Then Adam really would have seem'dAnother such a man!The pilgrim felt amazed, indeed,When he beheld his sire.He held a great stick in his hand,His face was flush'd with ire."Old man, old man, put down your stick.Why do you beat your son?""I'll cut the rascal to the quickIf he does what he've done.Why up in yonder apple treeGrandfeether risk'd his bones.And while the old man pick'd the fruit,The rascal dubb'd with stones."The pilgrim turn'd his head and saw,In a spreading apple tree,A very, very aged man.The eldest of the three.The pilgrim was a holy man,Whose hopes were in the sky.He fled   he thought it was a placeWhere man would never die.
