One day, when the tortoise was basking in the sun, a stag passed by,and stopped for a little conversation."Would you care to see which of us can run fastest?" asked thetortoise, after some talk.The stag thought the question so silly that he only shrugged hisshoulders."Of course, the victor would have the right to kill the other," went onthe tortoise."Oh, on that condition I agree," answered the deer, "but I am afraidthat you are a dead man.""It is no use trying to frighten me," replied the tortoise. "But Ishould like three days for training. then I shall be ready to start whenthe sun strikes on the big tree at the edge of the great clearing."The first thing the tortoise did was to call his brothers and hiscousins together, and he posted them carefully under ferns all along theline of the great clearing, making a sort of ladder which stretched formany miles. This done to his satisfaction, he went back to the startingplace.The stag was quite punctual, and as soon as the sun's rays struck thetrunk of the tree the stag started off, and was soon far out of the sightof the tortoise. Every now and then he would turn his head as he ran, andcall out, "How are you getting on?" and the tortoise who happened to benearest at the moment would answer, "All right, I am close up to you."Full of astonishment, the stag would redouble his efforts, but it wasno use. Each time he asked, "Are you there?" the answer would come, "Yes,of course, where else should I be?" And the stag ran, and ran, and ran,till he could run no more, and dropped down dead on the grass.And the tortoise, when he thinks about it, laughs still.
