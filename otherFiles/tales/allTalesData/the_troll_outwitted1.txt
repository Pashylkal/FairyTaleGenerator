A husbandman, who had a little mount on his field, resolved not to let itlie waste, and began to plow it up. At this the troll, who dwelt in themount, came out and demanded who it was that dared to plow on his roof.The husbandman said that he did not know it was his roof, and at the sametime represented to him that it was disadvantageous for both to let such apiece of land lie uncultivated. that he was willing to plow, sow and reapevery year, and that the troll should alternately have that which in oneyear grew on the earth, and the man that which grew beneath, and the nextyear the reverse. To this the troll agreed, and the man in the first yearsowed carrots, and in the year following, corn (grain), and gave the trollthe tops of the carrots and the roots of the corn. From that time therewas a good understanding between them.
