The Shetlanders believe in two kinds of trows, as they call theScandinavian trolls, those of the land and those of the sea. The former,whom, like the Scots, they also term the guid folk and guidneighbors, they conceive to inhabit the interior of green hills.Saining (blessing oneself) is the grand protection against them. aShetlander always sains himself when passing by their hills. Theyhave all the picking and stealing propensities of the Scandinavian trolls.Lying in women and "unchristened bairns" they regard as lawful prize.The former they employ as wet nurses, the latter they of course rear upas their own. Nothing will induce parents to show any attention to achild that they suspect of being a changeling. But there are persons whoundertake to enter the hills and regain the lost child.A tailor, not long since, related the following story. He was employedto work at a farm house where there was a child that was an idiot, andwho was supposed to have been left there by the trows instead of someproper child, whom they had taken into the hills.One night, after he had retired to his bed, leaving the idiot asleep bythe fire, he was suddenly waked out of his sleep by the sound of music,and on looking about him he saw the whole room full of fairies, who weredancing away their rounds most joyously. Suddenly the idiot jumped upand joined in the dance, and showed such a degree of acquaintance withthe various steps and movements as plainly testified that it must havebeen a long time since he first went under the hands of the dancingmaster. The tailor looked on for some time with admiration, but at lasthe grew alarmed and sained himself.On hearing this, the trows all fled in the utmost disorder, but one ofthem, a woman, was so incensed at this interruption of their revels, thatas she went out she touched the big toe of the tailor, and he lost thepower of ever after moving it.
