You know the tale of poor Little Red Riding Hood, that the wolf deceivedand devoured, with her cake, her little butter can, and her grandmother.Well, the true story happened quite differently, as we know now. And firstof all the little girl was called and is still called Little Golden Hood.secondly, it was not she, nor the good grand dame, but the wicked wolf whowas, in the end, caught and devoured.Only listen. The story begins something like the tale.There was once a little peasant girl, pretty and nice as a star in itsseason. Her real name was Blanchette, but she was more often called LittleGolden Hood, on account of a wonderful little cloak with a hood, gold  andfire colored, which she always had on. This little hood was given her byher grandmother, who was so old that she did not know her age. it ought tobring her good luck, for it was made of a ray of sunshine, she said. Andas the good old woman was considered something of a witch, everyonethought the little hood rather bewitched too.And so it was, as you will see.One day the mother said to the child, "Let us see, my Little Golden Hood,if you know now how to find your way by yourself. You shall take this goodpiece of cake to your grandmother for a Sunday treat tomorrow. You willask her how she is, and come back at once, without stopping to chatter onthe way with people you don't know. Do you quite understand?""I quite understand," replied Blanchette gaily. And off she went with thecake, quite proud of her errand.But the grandmother lived in another village, and there was a big wood tocross before getting there. At a turn of the road under the trees,suddenly, "Who goes there?""Friend wolf."He had seen the child start alone, and the villain was waiting to devourher. when at the same moment he perceived some woodcutters who mightobserve him, and he changed his mind. Instead of falling upon Blanchettehe came frisking up to her like a good dog."'Tis you! my nice Little Golden Hood," said he.So the little girl stops to talk with the wolf, who, for all that, she didnot know in the least."You know me, then!" said she. "What is your name?""My name is friend wolf. And where are you going thus, my pretty one, withyour little basket on your arm?""I am going to my grandmother, to take her a good piece of cake for herSunday treat tomorrow.""And where does she live, your grandmother?""She lives at the other side of the wood, in the first house in thevillage, near the windmill, you know.""Ah! yes! I know now," said the wolf. "Well, that's just where I'm going.I shall get there before you, no doubt, with your little bits of legs, andI'll tell her you're coming to see her. then she'll wait for you."Thereupon the wolf cuts across the wood, and in five minutes arrives atthe grandmother's house. He knocks at the door: toc, toc.No answer.He knocks louder.Nobody.Then he stands up on end, puts his two forepaws on the latch and the dooropens. Not a soul in the house. The old woman had risen early to sellherbs in the town, and she had gone off in such haste that she had lefther bed unmade, with her great nightcap on the pillow."Good!" said the wolf to himself, "I know what I'll do."He shuts the door, pulls on the grandmother's nightcap down to his eyes,then he lies down all his length in the bed and draws the curtains.In the meantime the good Blanchette went quietly on her way, as littlegirls do, amusing herself here and there by picking Easter daisies,watching the little birds making their nests, and running after thebutterflies which fluttered in the sunshine.At last she arrives at the door.Knock, knock."Who is there?" says the wolf, softening his rough voice as best he can."It's me, Granny, your Little Golden Hood. I'm bringing you a big piece ofcake for your Sunday treat tomorrow.""Press your finger on the latch, then push and the door opens.""Why, you've got a cold, Granny," said she, coming in."Ahem! a little, a little . . ." replies the wolf, pretending to cough."Shut the door well, my little lamb. Put your basket on the table, andthen take off your frock and come and lie down by me. You shall rest alittle."The good child undresses, but observe this! She kept her little hood uponher head. When she saw what a figure her Granny cut in bed, the poorlittle thing was much surprised."Oh!" cries she, "how like you are to friend wolf, Grandmother!""That's on account of my nightcap, child," replies the wolf."Oh! what hairy arms you've got, Grandmother!""All the better to hug you, my child.""Oh! what a big tongue you've got, Grandmother!""All the better for answering, child.""Oh ! what a mouthful of great white teeth you have, Grandmother!""That's for crunching little children with!"And the wolf opened his jaws wide to swallow Blanchette.But she put down her head crying, "Mamma! Mamma!" and the wolf only caughther little hood.Thereupon, oh dear! oh dear! he draws back, crying and shaking his jaw asif he had swallowed red hot coals. It was the little fire colored hoodthat had burnt his tongue right down his throat.The little hood, you see, was one of those magic caps that they used tohave in former times, in the stories, for making oneself invisible orinvulnerable. So there was the wolf with his throat burnt, jumping off thebed and trying to find the door, howling and howling as if all the dogs inthe country were at his heels.Just at this moment the grandmother arrives, returning from the town withher long sack empty on her shoulder."Ah, brigand!" she cries, "wait a bit!" Quickly she opens her sack wideacross the door, and the maddened wolf springs in head downwards.It is he now that is caught, swallowed like a letter in the post. For thebrave old dame shuts her sack, so. and she runs and empties it in thewell, where the vagabond, still howling, tumbles in and is drowned."Ah, scoundrel! you thought you would crunch my little grandchild! Well,tomorrow we will make her a muff of your skin, and you yourself shall becrunched, for we will give your carcass to the dogs."Thereupon the grandmother hastened to dress poor Blanchette, who was stilltrembling with fear in the bed."Well," she said to her, "without my little hood where would you be now,darling?" And, to restore heart and legs to the child, she made her eat agood piece of her cake, and drink a good draught of wine, after which shetook her by the hand and led her back to the house.And then, who was it who scolded her when she knew all that had happened?It was the mother.But Blanchette promised over and over again that she would never more stopto listen to a wolf, so that at last the mother forgave her. AndBlanchette, the Little Golden Hood, kept her word. And in fine weather shemay still be seen in the fields with her pretty little hood, the color ofthe sun. But to see her you must rise early.
