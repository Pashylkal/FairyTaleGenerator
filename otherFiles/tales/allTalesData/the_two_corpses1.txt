A soldier had obtained leave to go home on furlough   to pray to theholy images, and to bow down before his parents. And as he was going hisway, at a time when the sun had long set, and all was dark around, itchanced that he had to pass by a graveyard. Just then he heard that someone was running after him, and crying:"Stop! You can't escape!"He looked back and there was a corpse running and gnashing its teeth.The soldier sprang on one side with all his might to get away from it,caught sight of a little chapel, and bolted straight into it.There wasn't a soul in the chapel, but stretched out on a table therelay another corpse, with tapers burning in front of it. The soldier hidhimself in a corner, and remained there hardly knowing whether he wasalive or dead, but waiting to see what would happen. Presently up ran thefirst corpse   the one that had chased the soldier   and dashed into thechapel. Thereupon one that was lying on the table jumped up, and cried toit:"What hast thou come here for?""I've chased a soldier in here, so I'm going to eat him."Come now, brother! He's run into my house. I shall eat him myself.""No, I shall!""No, I shall!"And they set to work fighting. the dust flew like anything. They'd havegone on fighting ever so much longer, only the cocks began to crow. Thenboth the corpses fell lifeless to the ground, and the soldier went on hisway homeward in peace, saying:"Glory be to Thee. O Lord! I am saved from the wizards!"
