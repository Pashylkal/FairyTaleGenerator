She was veryindustrious and well behaved, but she would not say what her name was.One day the man was carrying a yoke home from the field when the voiceof an unseen person called out to him several times, "You, the mancarrying the yoke, tell Gloria that the chancellor has died."The man did not think about this occurance until suppertime, and thenhe related it to the girl, adding that he now knew that her name wasGloria. The girl immediately jumped head over heels and fled. And no onehas seen her since then.
