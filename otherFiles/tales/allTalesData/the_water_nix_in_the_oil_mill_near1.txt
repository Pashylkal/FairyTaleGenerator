FrauendorfAges ago a water nix would bring fish to the so called Oil Mill locatedat Frauendorf Manor on a channel of the River Spree near Cottbus. The nixwould ask the miller to cook the fish, after which the nix would eat themright at the mill. With time these uncanny visits came to annoy themiller, but he never dared to turn down his uninvited visitor'srequests.However, the time came when fate freed him from the nix.One evening a bear trainer came to Frauendorf with his tamed bear andasked the miller for a night's lodging. The latter, a good hearted man,did not refuse him. To keep it from harming anyone, the bear was chainedup behind the table in the main room.Not long afterward the nix entered the mill with a catch of fish. Withthe miller's permission he cooked them, and then sat down next to the bearbehind the table and began to eat them. The hungry bear could not resistthe tempting smell of the tasty meal, and wasted no time in helpinghimself from the nix's plate. This angered the nix, who struck at thebear's paws with his spoon. The bear let this happen a few times, but whenthe blows became more painful, he became furious. He grabbed the nix andcrushed him terribly, until the bear trainer jumped up and rescued thenearly dead nix from the beast's claws.The nix ran quickly out the door, jumped into the water, and was notseen again for a whole year. At the end of this time, the miller was oneday working near his waterway, when the nix, wearing his red cap, suddenlyemerged from the water, greeted the miller, then asked with a whiningvoice, "Master miller, do you still have that large cat?"The miller, fearing that the nix wanted to take up his regular visitsagain, quickly answered, "Yes, she is lying behind the stove, and she hasninety nine young ones!"To this the nix replied, "I'll never again come to your place!" Then hedisappeared beneath the water and was never seen there again.
