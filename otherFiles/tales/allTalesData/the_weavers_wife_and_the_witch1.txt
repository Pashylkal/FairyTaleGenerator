Once upon a time a weaver and his wife lived at lived at Sutton on Trentin Nottinghamshire. One day the weaver went to Neward to sell his linen,leaving his children in the house, and his wife, who lay ill in bed. Nowat that time there lived at Sutton a witch who had some spite against theweaver's wife. A short time after the weaver had gone one of the childrenheard a noise as of something pattering up and down stairs. The childopened the door of the bottom stairs, and there she saw a great ugly cat,which she could not catch, try as she would. As she was trying to catch itthe cat ran upstairs, sprang upon the bed where the poor woman lay, andclawed her. But the woman roused herself and knocked the cat down.Now when the weaver came back from Newark the children told him about thecat. So he watched all night in an old lumber room, for the cat came inand went out through a broken pane in the window.One night the cat came in as the weaver was sitting by the fire, so hepicked up a fork and struck her on the cheek. He then threw her out ofdoors, believing that she was dead. But in the morning, when he went tolook for the cat's body, he could not find it. But ever after that thewitch had her face tied up, and she had no more power to do harm to theweaver or to his family.
