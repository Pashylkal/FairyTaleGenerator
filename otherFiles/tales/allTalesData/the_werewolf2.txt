The WerewolfThree workmen were mowing a meadow. Noon came, but no one had broughtthem their meal yet, so they agreed to mow one more round and then to liedown beneath a bush until the food arrived. And that is what they did.Two of them fell asleep immediately, because one never sleeps better thanwhen one is tired, and there is no softer bed than one made from flowersand grass.The third workman, however, tied a wolf strap around his waist and creptup to a herd of horses that was grazing there. The best foal was justright for him. He grabbed it and killed it. The remaining horses andthe herder ran off. The other harvesters saw what had happened, but theywisely pretended to be asleep, for they were frightened and horrified.After the werewolf had satisfied his hunger, he took off the strap, cameback, and lay down to rest. Their food soon arrived: a large pot fullof porridge and for each man six boiled eggs plus some bread and salt.As the two harvesters were helping themselves with their wooden spoons,the werewolf said, "Earlier I was terribly hungry, but for some reason Idon't feel like eating now." The two others said nothing.The one harvester complained the entire afternoon about cramps and astomach ache, and often went to the brook to quench his burning thirst.The two others said nothing. That evening, as they were on their wayhome, he said once again that he had never felt so stuffed, to which oneof the harvesters replied that it could happen to anyone.When they arrived at the town gate, and he was still complaining, theother workman said, "A person who eats an entire foal should not besurprised to feel stuffed and have stomach cramps.To that he replied, "If you had said that earlier, you would not now bewalking home on your own legs." He then threw his scythe away, tied thestrap around his waist, turned into a wolf, and was never again seen inthat place.
