About sixty years ago in Alt Marrin there lived a man by the name ofGust K. He too possessed a wolf strap, with which he brought about muchdamage and misery. Finally the strap was taken from him, and it was to beburned. Three times the baking oven was heated up, and three times thestrap was thrown into the glowing fire, but each time it jumped back outof the flames.Nor would water damage the strap. It always returned.However, the pastor from Fritzow finally burned it up. When Gust K.died, the pastor at Alt Marrin could not finish the Lord's Prayer, andthey called on the pastor from Fritzow. The latter said, "Away, away withit!"When they tried to lower him into the earth, the grave opening was toosmall, so the pallbearers had to trample him down with their feet. For along time afterward there was always a hole in his grave mound, but itwill have closed up by now, for grass has been growing over the story ofGust K. for a long time now.
