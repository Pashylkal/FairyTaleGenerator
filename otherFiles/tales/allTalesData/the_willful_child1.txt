Once upon a time there was a child who was willful and did not do what hismother wanted. For this reason God was displeased with him and caused himto become ill,and no doctor could help him, and in a short time he lay on hisdeathbed.He was lowered into a grave and covered with earth, but his little armsuddenly cameforth and reached up, and it didn't help when they put it back in and putfreshearth over it, for the little arm always came out again. So the motherherselfhad to go to the grave and beat the little arm with a switch, and as soonas shehad done that, it withdrew, and the child finally came to rest beneath theearth.
