Once there was a wealthy peasant, whose wife   the people said   wasa witch. This was repeated so often that the peasant himself finally heardthe rumor. He wanted to get to the bottom of the matter, and thus one daybefore May Night he went out and got some turf from the grave of a childwho had died without being baptized. He secretly hid the turf then went tobed with his wife. He closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep, althoughhe remained awake and attentive.At the strike of twelve his wife did indeed get up and sneak out thebedroom door. The peasant, taking turf with him, followed her outside thehouse door, where she suddenly disappeared. He saw nothing but a troop ofblack horses. But the peasant did not allow himself to be deceived.Quickly placing the turf on his head, he saw   instead of the blackhorses   women and girls of his acquaintance. In their midst was hiswife. He also heard them discussing their trip to Block Mountain. Herecognized them, because anyone beneath the earth can see witches andspirits in their true form.Angered, the peasant jumped at his wife and swung himself onto her,just as one would climb onto an ordinary horse's back. He also knewwitches' magic words and called out:Horse of black, horse so fleet,Do you duty with quick feet.Then she rose up and carried him into the air. She did not tire fromthe mighty ride, nor did the peasant grow tired. Again and again he calledout:Horse of black, horse so fleet,Do you duty with quick feet.But that was his misfortune, because before he knew it, May Night wasover. Morning broke across the mountains, and his wife was no longer ablack horse. She let out a pitiful scream, and together they fell fromhigh in the air, horribly smashing themselves to pieces.From that time forth they have made this same ride every night, andthey will have no rest until the day of judgement.
