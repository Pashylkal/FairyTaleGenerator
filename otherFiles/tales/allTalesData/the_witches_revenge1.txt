Many years ago a night watchman in Schwerte was courting two sisters atthe same time, but without being serious about marriage. Each of themasked him about this several times, but to no avail. Therefore at lastthey got together and swore revenge against him. Now both of thesesisters were witches. One night when the night watchman was lying in bedthere came a knock at his window. When he opened it, the two of them tookhold of him, picked him up, and carried him high into the air. At firstthey wanted to throw him into the Ruhr River, but they reconsidered andset him, entirely naked, at the top of a tall tree where he was found halfdead the next day.
