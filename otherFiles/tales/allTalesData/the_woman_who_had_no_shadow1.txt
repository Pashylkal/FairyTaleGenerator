Once there was a pastor's wife who was afraid to have children. Otherwomen are concerned when they have no children, but she was constantlyafraid that she could have children.One day she went to a wise woman, a wicked witch, and asked her what todo to avoid having children. The wise woman gave her seven stones and toldher if she would throw them into the well she would be spared from havingchildren.The pastor's wife threw the stones into the well. As each stonesplashed below, she thought that she heard the cry of a child, but stillshe felt a great sense of relief.Some time later the pastor and his wife were walking across the churchyardby the light of a full moon, when the pastor suddenly noticed that hiswife did not have a shadow. This frightened him, and he asked her for anexplanation, stating that she must have committed a dreadful sin, a sinthat she would have to confess to him.He continued to press her for a confession, until finally she admittedwhat she had done. Upon hearing her story, he angrily proclaimed, "Cursedwoman! Flowers will grow from our slate roof before God forgives you ofthis sinful deed!" With that he sent her away, telling her to never againstep across his threshold.One night, many years later, a wretched and tattered beggar womanapproached the parsonage and asked for shelter. The housekeeper gave thepoor woman a bit to eat and made a bed for her next to the kitchenstove.The next morning the pastor found the beggar woman dead on the kitchenfloor. In spite of her rags, he recognized her immediately as the woman hehad cursed and disowned. As he stood there contemplating her lifeless, butserene face, his housekeeper burst into the room. "Pastor!" she exclaimed."Come outside! A miracle has happened during the night!" The pastorfollowed her outside and saw that his slate roof was covered withblossoming flowers.
