Castle Rushen has long been famous for its subterranean passages, andthere are individuals amongst the islanders who still firmly believe thatthey lead to a beautiful country underground, inhabited by giants.Amongst the many tales they relate is one, that, several attempts beingmade to explore the passages, which in general proved unsuccessful, anumber of daring fellows agreed to attempt the enterprise in company.Having armed themselves with staves, etc., etc., and procuring torches,they descended. After proceeding a little way, they found an old man, ofgreat size, with a long beard, and blind, sitting on a rock as if fixedthere. He, hearing them approach, enquired of them as to the state of theisland, and at last asked one to put forth his hand, on which one of themgave him a plowshare which he had, when the old giant squeezed the irontogether with the greatest ease, explaining at the same time: "Then thereare yet men in the Isle of Man."
