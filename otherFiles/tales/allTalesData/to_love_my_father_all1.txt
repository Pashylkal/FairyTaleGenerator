LearWhich of you shall we say doth love us most?That we our largest bounty may extendWhere nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,Our eldest born, speak first.GonerilSir, I love you more than words can wield the matter,Dearer than eye sight, space and liberty,Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour,As much as child e'er loved or father found.A love that makes breath poor and speech unable.Beyond all manner of so much I love you....ReganI am made of that self metal as my sister,And prize me at her worth. In my true heartI find she names my very deed of love.Only she comes too short: that I professMyself an enemy to all other joysWhich the most precious square of sense possesses,And find I am alone felicitateIn your dear highness' love...CordeliaI cannot heaveMy heart into my mouth: I love your majestyAccording to my bond. nor more nor less.LearHow, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,Lest it may mar your fortunes.CordeliaGood my lord,You have begot me, bred me, loved me: IReturn those duties back as are right fit,Obey you, love you, and most honour you.Why have my sisters husbands, if they sayThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carryHalf my love with him half my care and duty:Sure, I shall never marry like my sister,To love my father all.
