CuckooA damsel fell in love with a snake, and was also beloved by him. Hetook her to wife. His dwelling was of pure glass, all crystal. Thisdwelling was situated underground, in a kind of mound, or something of thesort.Well, it is said that her old mother at first grieved over her. Howcould she help doing so?Well, when the time came, the snake's wife became the mother of twins,a boy and a girl. They looked, as they lay by their mother, as if theywere made of wax. And she was herself as beautiful as a flower.Well, God having given her children, she said, "Now, then, since theyhave been born as human beings, let us christen them among humanbeings."She took her seat in a golden carriage, laid the children on her knees,and drove off to the village to the pope (orthodox priest). The carriagehad not got into the open country, when sadness was brought to the mother.The old woman had made an outcry in the whole village, seized a sickle,and rushed into the country.She (the young mother) saw she had manifest death before her, when shecalled to her children, and went on to say, "Fly, my children, as birdsabout the world. You, my little son, as a nightingale, and you, mydaughter, as a cuckoo."Out flew a nightingale from the carriage by the right hand, and acuckoo by the left hand window. What became of the carriage and horses andall, nobody knows. Nor did their mistress remain, only a dead nettlesprang up by the roadside.
