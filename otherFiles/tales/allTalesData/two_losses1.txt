During a great storm at sea, a learned man heard theskipper giving his orders, but could not understanda word. When the danger was past, he asked the skipperin what language he had spoken.The sailor replied: "Inmy mother tongue, of course!"The scholar expressed hisregret that a man should have wasted half his life withoutlearning to speak grammatically and intelligibly. A fewhours later the storm arose again, and this time theship sprang a leak and began to founder. Then the captainwent to the scholar and asked if he could swim.The man of books replied that he had never learned."I am sorry, sir, for you will lose your whole life. The shipwill go to the bottom in a minute, and my crew andI shall swim ashore. You would have donewell if you had spent a little of your timein learning to swim."
