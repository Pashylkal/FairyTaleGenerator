StallOral, from BergkirchenThe chief steward of a farm in the vicinity of Bergkirchen had beenplagued with misfortune for some time. Many horses were dying, and no oneknew why. One day his wife was standing at the hearth baking a pancakewhen a little man approached her and said that their horse stall, whichwas directly above the dwelling of the underground people, was causing themisfortune. If they would move it, everything would go well with them.The chief steward immediately moved the horses to another location. Tothank him, the underground people invited him to stand as godparent (forone of their children). Arriving underground, he was shown the place wherethe drippings from his manure pile formerly had fallen onto their table,and they thanked him that he now had moved it.In parting they gave him a few handfuls of floor sweepings. When hereturned above ground they turned into pure gold.
