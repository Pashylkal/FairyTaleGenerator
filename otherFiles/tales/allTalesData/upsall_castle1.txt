Many years ago there resided in the village of Upsall a man who dreamedthree nights successively that if he went to London Bridge he would hearof something greatly to his advantage. He went, traveling the wholedistance from Upsall to London on foot. Arrived there, he took his stationon the bridge, where he waited till his patience was nearly exhausted, andthe idea that he had acted a very foolish part began to arise in his mind.At length he was accosted by a Quaker, who kindly inquired what he waswaiting there so long for. After some hesitation, he told his dreams. TheQuaker laughed at his simplicity, and told him that he had had thatnight a very curious dream himself, which was, that if he went and dugunder a certain bush in Upsall Castle in Yorkshire, he would find a pot ofgold. but he did not know where Upsall was, and inquired of the countrymanif he knew, who, seeing some advantage in secrecy, pleaded ignorance ofthe locality. and then, thinking his business in London was completed,returned immediately home, dug beneath the bush, and there he found a potfilled with gold, and on the cover an inscription in a language he did notunderstand.The pot and cover were, however, preserved at the village inn, whereone day a bearded stranger like a Jew made his appearance, saw the pot,and read the inscription, the plain English of which was:Look lower, where this stoodIs another twice as good.The man of Upsall, hearing this, resumed his spade, returned to thebush, dug deeper, and found another pot filled with gold far more valuablethan the first. Encouraged by this, he dug deeper still, and found anotheryet more valuable.This story has been related of other places, but Upsall appears to haveas good a claim to this yielding of hidden treasure as the best of them.Here we have the constant tradition of the inhabitants, and the identicalbush still remains beneath which the treasure was found   an elder nearthe northwest corner of the ruins.
