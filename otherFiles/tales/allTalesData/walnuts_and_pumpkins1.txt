Nasreddin Hodja was lying in the shade of an ancient walnut tree. Hisbody was at rest, but, befitting his calling as an imam, his mind did notrelax. Looking up into the mighty tree he considered the greatness andwisdom of Allah."Allah is great and Allah is good," said the Hodja, "but was it indeedwise that such a great tree as this be created to bear only tiny walnutsas fruit? Behold the stout stem and strong limbs. They could easily carrythe pumpkins that grow from spindly vines in yonder field, vines thatcannot begin to bear the weight of their own fruit. Should not walnutsgrow on weakly vines and pumpkins on sturdy trees?"So thinking, the Hodja dosed off, only to be awakened by a walnut thatfell from the tree, striking him on his forehead."Allah be praised!" he exclaimed, seeing what had happened. "If theworld had been created according to my meager wisdom, it would have been apumpkin that fell from the tree and hit me on the head. It would havekilled me for sure! Allah is great! Allah is good! Allah is wise!"Never again did Nasreddin Hodja question the wisdom of Allah.
