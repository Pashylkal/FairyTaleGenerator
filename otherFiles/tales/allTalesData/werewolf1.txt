A servant understood how to do this, andwhile the others were asleep at noontime he ate an entire foal. One of themen just pretended to be asleep and observed everything. From Glane nearIburg.If you throw a piece of iron or steel over a hare that is a transformedhuman, or over a werewolf, then the human will immediately appear beforeyou completely naked. They call that "making blank" the witch, the wolf,and so forth. The werewolf's pelt bursts crosswise at its forehead, andthe naked human emerges from this opening.
