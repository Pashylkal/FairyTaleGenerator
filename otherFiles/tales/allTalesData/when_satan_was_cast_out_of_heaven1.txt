Know that when Satan was cast out of heaven, on account of his pride,and fell to the earth, there were other spirits, which, like him, werealso cast out. These spirits, in their fall, were borne hither and thitheron the winds like the golden leaves in the autumn storm, falling to earthfinally, some into the sea, some into the forests, and some upon themountains. Where they fell there they remained, so the saying runs, andfound there their field of action. After their abiding places they weregiven different names. Thus we have sea nymphs, mountain fairies, woodfairies, elves, and other spirits, all of which are described in thecatechism.
