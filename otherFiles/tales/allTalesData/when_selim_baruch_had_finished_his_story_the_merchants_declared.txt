themselves delighted therewith. "Verily, the afternoon has passed awayfrom us without our having observed it!" exclaimed one of them,throwing back the covering of the tent: "the evening wind blows cool,we can still make a good distance on our journey." To this hiscompanions agreed. the tents were struck, and the Caravan proceeded onits way in the same order in which it had come up.They rode almost all the night long, for it was refreshing andstarry, whereas the day was sultry. At last they arrived at aconvenient stopping place. here they pitched their tents, and composedthemselves to rest. To the stranger the merchants attended, as a mostvalued guest. One gave him cushions, a second covering, a thirdslaves. in a word, he was as well provided for as if he had been athome. The hottest hours of the day had already arrived, when theyawoke again, and they unanimously determined to wait for evening inthis place. After they had eaten together, they moved more closely toeach other, and the young merchant, turning to the oldest, addressedhim: "Selim Baruch yesterday made a pleasant afternoon for us. supposeAchmet, that you also tell us something, be it either from your longlife, which has known so many adventures, or even a pretty Marchen."Upon these words Achmet was silent some time, as if he were in doubtwhether to tell this or that. at last he began to speak: "Dearfriends, on this our journey you have proved yourselves faithfulcompanions, and Selim also deserves my confidence. I will thereforeimpart to you something of my life, of which, under othercircumstances, I would speak reluctantly, and, indeed, not to any one:THE HISTORY OF THE SPECTRE SHIP."
