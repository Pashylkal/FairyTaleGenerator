Ansa was King of Calabar for fifty years. He had a very faithful cat asa housekeeper, and a rat was his house boy. The king was an obstinate,headstrong man, but was very fond of the cat, who had been in his storefor many years.The rat, who was very poor, fell in love with one of the king's servantgirls, but was unable to give her any presents, as he had no money.At last he thought of the king's store, so in the nighttime, beingquite small, he had little difficulty, having made a hole in the roof, ingetting into the store. He then stole corn and native pears, and presentedthem to his sweetheart.At the end of the month, when the cat had to render her account of thethings in the store to the king, it was found that a lot of corn andnative pears were missing. The king was very angry at this, and asked thecat for an explanation. But the cat could not account for the loss, untilone of her friends told her that the rat had been stealing the corn andgiving it to the girl.When the cat told the king, he called the girl before him and had herflogged. The rat he handed over to the cat to deal with, and dismissedthem both from his service. The cat was so angry at this that she killedand ate the rat, and ever since that time whenever a cat sees a rat shekills and eats it.
