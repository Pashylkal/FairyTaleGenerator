Some time ago a woman called Castle Lady and who was thought to be a witchlived in a small hut in Manternach. One night two cats came to the bedroomwindow of a man and howled pitifully. When the man got up and went outsidethe one cat ran away. The man grabbed the other one and beat itthoroughly, then threw it down the steps. Nevertheless it returned, andthe man beat it until it stuck all four legs up. then he threw it over thewall into the garden.The next morning Castle Lady came to him and complained of pain throughouther entire body. The man said, "So, you old rascal, you are the one whomade such a spectacle last night, the one I threw down the steps?""Yes, I am the one," said the woman miserably.
