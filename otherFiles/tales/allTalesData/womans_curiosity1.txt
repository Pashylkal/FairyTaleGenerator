A shepherd saved the life of the daughter of the king of snakes, theprincess narrowly escaping being burnt to death. To show him her gratitudeshe taught him the language of animals, and he was able to understandthem.One day his donkey said something that made him smile. whereupon his wifecommenced to tease him, and wanted to know the joke, but the shepherd wasunable to gratify her wish, as his betraying the secret would haveimmediately been followed by the penalty of sudden death. However the wifewould not give in and leave him in peace, but continued to torment herhusband with so many questions that he at last determined to die ratherthan to bear his wife's ill temper any longer.With this view he had his coffin made and brought to his house. he laiddown in the coffin quite prepared for death and ready to divulge thesecret.His faithful dog sat mournfully by his side watching, while the cockbelonging to the house merrily hopped about in the room. The dogremonstrated with the cock and said that this was not the time formerriment, seeing how near their master was to death.But the cock replied quite curtly, "It's master's own fault! Why is hesuch a great fool and coward? Look at me! I have fifty wives, and they alldo as I tell them to do! If I can get on with so many, surely he ought tobe able to manage one!"Hearing this the shepherd jumped out of the coffin, seized a wet rope endand gave the woman a sound thrashing. Peace was restored, and they livedhappily together ever after.
