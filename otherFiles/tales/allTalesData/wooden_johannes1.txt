A woman so loved her husband that she vowed not to remarry followinghis death. Thus she had a wooden statue carved and painted that resembledher husband in form, shape, and size. She called it "Wooden Johannes," andit was to serve as her companion in place of her husband if she were tobecome a widow.Her fears were confirmed, and her husband did indeed die. After she hadmourned in earnest for almost half a year, her grief became somewhateasier to bear.One evening she was invited out by her relatives, and she gave her maidorders not to forget to lay Wooden Johannes into her bed as soon as he waswarm, and then to come and get her. It was her custom to put WoodenJohannes into her bed every evening before she went to bed. During the dayhe stood next to the stove.The maid thought that the time was right to look after her own kin,considering that her mistress would be in a good mood following herevening out. Therefore she sent for her brother, who was a well formed andgood looking young man. She told him her plan and led him to hermistress's bed. She then hid Wooden Johannes somewhere else and went toget her mistress. Arriving back home with her, she lit a candle in themistress's bedroom, and then went to bed herself.Now this Johannes warmed the mistress so well, that she did not removehim from her bed as soon as he had cooled down, as was her practice withthe other one, but kept him by her side until morning.The maid came, as she did every morning, and asked if she should go tothe market and buy something. The mistress asked her to look for some goodfish to eat."Gladly," answered the maid, "but if I do get some, I'm sure that thereis not enough dry wood in the house to fry them properly.""Oh," said the mistress, "then use Wooden Johannes. He is dry enough.Chop him up and cook with him as long as he lasts."Thus the maid brought her brother to great wealth, for he warmed themistress so well that she kept him and married him.
