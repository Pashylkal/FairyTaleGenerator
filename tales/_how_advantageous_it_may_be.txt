By long descent of pedigree,T'enjoy a great estate,Yet knowledge how to act, we see,Join'd with consummate industry,(Nor wonder ye thereat)Doth often prove a greater boon,As should be to young people known.__If the son of a miller so soon gains the heartOf a beautiful princess, and makes her impartSweet languishing glances, eyes melting for love,It must be remark'd of fine clothes how they move,And that youth, a good face, a good air, with good mien,Are not always indifferent mediums to winThe love of the fair, and gently inspireThe flames of sweet passion, and tender desire._
