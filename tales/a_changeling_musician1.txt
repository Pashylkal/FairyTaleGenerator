The Fairy Faith in Celtic CountriesA family at Dalby (Isle of Man) had a poor idiot baby, and when it wastwenty years old it still sat by the fire just like a child. A tailorcame to the house to work on a day when all the folks were out cuttingcorn, and the idiot was left with him. The tailor began to whistle as hesat on the table sewing, and the little idiot sitting by the fire said tohim: "If you'll not tell anybody when they come in, I'll dance that tunefor you."So the little fellow began to dance, and he could step it outsplendidly. Then he said to the tailor: "If you'll not tell anybody whenthey come in, I'll play the fiddle for you." And the tailor and theidiot spent a very enjoyable afternoon together.But before the family came in from the fields, the poor idiot, as usual,was sitting in a chair by the fire, a big baby who couldn't hardly talk.When the mother came in she happened to say to the tailor, "You've a finechap her," referring to the idiot."Yes, indeed," said the tailor, "we've had a very fine afternoontogether. but I think we had better make a good fire and put him on it.""Oh!" cried the mother, "the poor child could never even walk.""Ah, but he can dance and play the fiddle, too," replied the tailor.And the fire was made. but when the idiot saw that they were for puttinghim on it he pulled from his pocket a ball, and this ball went rolling onahead of him, and he, going after it, was never seen again.After this strange story was finished I asked Mrs. Moore where she hadheard it, and she said: "I have heard this story ever since I was agirl. I knew the house and family, and so did my mother. The family'sname was Cubbon."
