One night Nasreddin awoke, thinking he had heard a strange noiseoutside his window. Looking out, he saw a suspicious white figure."Who goes there?" shouted the Hodja.Hearing no reply, Nasreddin reached for his bow, set an arrow to thestring, took aim, and shot in the direction of the mysterious figure.Satisfied that the intruder now would do him no harm, Nasreddin returnedto bed and slept until dawn.By morning's light he examined the scene outside his window, only todiscover his own white shirt hanging on the clothesline and pierced by thearrow that he had shot during the night."That was a close call," murmured the Hodja. "My own shirt, shotthrough by an arrow! What if I had been wearing it at the time!"
