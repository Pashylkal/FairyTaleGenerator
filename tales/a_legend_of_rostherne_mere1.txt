Merrily, merrily rang the bells,The bells o'er Rostherne mere,The tale of joy their soft echo tellsE'en Bowden heights may hear.At Rostherne church long, long ago,Repairs some workmen make,When, as they laboured cheerily oh,They felt the tower shake.As the tower shook, the largest bellWas riven from its place,And eke loud clattering down it fell,And rolling 'gan apace.Down the steep cliff like bank it rolledThat frowns above the mere,Through the fragrant birch and lindens old,At length the lake drew near.It stopped at the brink. hard strove the menTo force it up the crag,Back to the tower to strain againOh 'twas a weary drag!A sulky labourer madly cried,"Oh, would the Devil had you!"But scarce he'd spoke when the bell beliedTo the wave downwards flew.But first in its headlong course it crushedTh' unlucky wight who swore,Then down the wild crag madly rushed.They never saw it more.Sunk in the depths of that mere profoundTo which there's bottom none,And as it sank a dull gurgling soundJust to the surface won.Now sadly, oh! sadly moans the peal,And mourns that fatal hour.They seem o'er the bell to ring a knellThat fell from Rostherne tower.
