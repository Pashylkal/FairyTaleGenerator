The Fairy Faith in Celtic CountriesA woman who lived near Breage Church (Isle of Man) had a fine girl baby,and she thought the piskies came and took it and put a withered child inits place. The withered child lived to be twenty years old, and was nolarger when it died than when the piskies brought it. It was fretful andpeevish and frightfully shriveled. The parents believed that the piskiesoften used to come and look over a certain wall by the house to see thechild. And I heard my grandmother say that the family once put the childout of doors at night to see if the piskies would take it back again.
