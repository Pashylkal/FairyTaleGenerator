TrollAs a smith was at work in his forge late one evening, he heard greatwailing out on the road, and by the light of the red hot iron that he washammering, he saw a woman whom a troll was driving along, bawling at her"A little more! A little more!" He ran out, put the red hot iron betweenthem, and thus delivered her from the power of the troll.He led her into his house and that night she was delivered oftwins.In the morning he waited on (went to) her husband, who he supposed mustbe in great affliction at the loss of his wife. But to his surprise he sawthere, in bed, a woman the very image of her he had saved from the troll.Knowing at once what she must be, he raised an axe he had in his hand, andcleft her skull.The matter was soon explained to the satisfaction of the husband, whogladly received his real wife and her twins.
