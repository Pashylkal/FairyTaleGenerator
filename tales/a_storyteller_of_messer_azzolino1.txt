Messer Azzolino had a storyteller whom he made tell him tales duringthe long nights of winter. It happened that one night the storyteller hada great desire to sleep, while Azzolino urged him to tell tales.The storyteller began a tale of a countryman who had a hundredbyzantines (ancient coins) of his own which he took with him to the marketto buy sheep at the price of two per byzantine. Returning with his sheephe came to a river he had passed before much swollen with the rains whichhad recently fallen. Standing on the bank, he saw a poor fisherman with aboat, but of so small a size that there was only room for the countrymanand one sheep at a time. Then the countryman began to cross over with onesheep, and he began to row. The river was wide. He rowed and passedover.And here the storyteller ceased his tale.Azzolino said, "Go on!"And the storyteller replied, "Let the sheep cross over, and then I willtell you the tale."Since the sheep would not have crossed in a year, he could meanwhilesleep at his ease.
