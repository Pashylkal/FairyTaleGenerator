During heathen times the Sorbian Wends of Lausitz practiced the shamefuland gruesome custom of ridding themselves of their old people who were nolonger able to contribute. A son would strike his own father dead when hebecame old and incompetent, or he would throw him into water, or he wouldpush him over a high cliff. Indeed, there are many examples of this, evenafter the advent of Christianity.For example: Herr Levin von Schulenburg, a high official in Altmark, wastraveling among the Wends in about 1580 when he saw an old man being ledaway by several people. "Where are you going with the old man?" he asked,and received the answer, "To God!"They were going to sacrifice him to God, because he was no longer able toearn his own sustenance. When the official grasped what was happening, heforced them to turn the old man over to him. He took him home with himand hired him as a gatekeeper, a position that he held for twentyadditional years.
