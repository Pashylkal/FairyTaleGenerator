Whenever a certain peasant brewed beer, someone drank it all up duringthe night. He finally decided to stay up and keep watch throughout thenight.He did this, and as he was standing by his vat, a large number of catsapproached him. He called out to them:Here kitty,Here cat,Come and warm yourselves!Then they all sat down in a large circle around the fire and warmedthemselves.After they had sat there for a little while, he asked them if the waterwas hot."It is almost boiling!" they answered, and as soon as they said this,he took the ladle and sprinkled the whole lot of them, whereupon they alldisappeared in an instant.The next day his wife had a badly burned face, so he knew who had beendrinking up his beer.
