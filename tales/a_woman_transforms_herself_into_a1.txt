WerewolfIn a village there lived a woman whose first name was Trine. Herhusband had been dead for a long time. The woman lived in impoverishedcircumstances, but nonetheless, she was always able to offer fresh meat tothose who visited her.One time a male relative came to visit her, and she offered him goodfresh meat.The man said to her, "Tell me, Trine, where did you get this nicemutton?"Trine answered, "I'll show you. Just climb up onto the roof with theladder that is leaning against the back of the house."The man did what Trine asked him to do. In the distance he saw a herdof sheep. Suddenly a wolf came out of the brush, ran into the midst of thesheep, and was about to run away with one of them. The shepherd saw thisin time, and with his dog took off after the wolf in order to rescue thesheep. The wolf defended itself.The man on the roof, knowing what kind of wolf it was, called out,"Trine, watch out!"Suddenly Trine was standing there in her true form. Then the shepherdbegan striking out at her with renewed vigor, and Trine was scarcely ableto drag herself back home.
