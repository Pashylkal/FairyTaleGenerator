On the side of Mount Pilatus is a place name the Kastler Alp, now coveredwith stones and rubble, but which once was verdant and fertile. The causeof the change was as follows:The land there was formerly occupied by a farmer, a churlish, unfeelingman, who, though wealthy, let his only sister struggle with the greatestpoverty in the valley beneath. The poor woman at length having fallensick, and seeing no other resource, resolved to apply to her hard heartedbrother for the means of employing a doctor. She sent her daughter tohim. but all the prayers and tears of the poor girl failed to move him,and he told her he would sooner than give her anything, see the Alpcovered with stones and rubble. She departed, and as she went along, adwarf suddenly appeared to her. She would have fled, but he gentlydetained her, and telling her he had heard all that had passed, gave her aparcel of herbs, which he assured her would cure her mother, and a littlecheese, which he said would last them a long time.On trial, the herbs quickly produced the promised effect. and when theywent to cut the cheese they found the knife would not penetrate it, and nowonder, for it was pure gold.There also came a sudden storm on the mountain, and the Kastler Alp wasreduced to its present condition.
