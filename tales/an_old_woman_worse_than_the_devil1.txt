Once upon a time there was a married couple who lived peacefully with eachother. This irritated the devil, so he went to an old woman in the villageand said to her, "If you can bring discord between these two marriedpeople, you shall have a pair of leather slippers."She said, "We shall see."Then she went to the wife when she was home alone and said, "Do you have agood husband, and do you get along well with him?""Yes," she answered, "I could never find a better husband in my wholelife.""Good," said the old woman. "I will tell you a means of guaranteeing thatyou will never quarrel with him. This evening, after he has gone to bedand fallen asleep, take a knife and cut off a few of the hairs that growon his Adam's apple. If you do that, you will never quarrel with oneanother."Then she left the house and went to the husband in the field and said tohim, "Do you have a very good wife?""Yes," said the husband."Oh," replied the old woman, "I would not trust womenfolk. Don't trustyour wife too much. You should know that tonight while you are asleep sheintends to slit your throat."The husband took notice of this, and that evening he pretended to beasleep. He did indeed see that his wife was silently approaching him witha knife. Then he jumped up, ripped the knife from her hand, and slit herthroat.When the devil brought the red leather slippers to the old woman he heldthem out to her on a long beanpole.The old woman asked, "Why are you doing that?""You are much, much worse that I am," said the devil, "and not worthy forme to give you the slippers with my hand."
