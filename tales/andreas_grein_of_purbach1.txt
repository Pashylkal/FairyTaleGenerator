During the Turkish wars the wild hordes of riders advanced as far asPurbach. On such occasions the townspeople of Purbach fled into the nearbyLeitha Mountains to seek refuge there from the hordes. During one suchattack Andreas Grein remained at home.When the Turkish horde found Grein, they placed him in handcuffs, tiedhim to a horse's tail, and thus forced him to run along behind. The Turkstook Grein back to their country, where he was housed in a stall andforced to pull a plow by day. For food he received nuts and millet.After seven years of terrible suffering he succeeded   with the helpof a fellow countrywoman   in escaping from Turkey. In October 1647,after traveling on foot for many months, he arrived at Purbach. He stoppedto rest on his own property, about 1000 steps from the town. He then wentto his home, where he encountered his wife, who had recently remarried.She did not recognize Grein, because of his wild appearance. After muchdiscussion she recognized her husband from his voice. She asked him forforgiveness, and they lived happily together until they died. The secondhusband, of course, had to step aside.At the place where he had rested, Grein erected a Holy Trinity column,inscribed with the year 1647.
