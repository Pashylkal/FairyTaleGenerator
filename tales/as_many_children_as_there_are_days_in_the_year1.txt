Loosduynen (Leusden) is a small village one mile from The Hague. In the church there they still point out two baptismal fonts with theinscription, "In deze twee beckens zyn alle deze kinderen ghedoopt (Allthe children were baptized in these two fonts)." A plaque hanging nearby, inscribed with Latin and Dutch verses, commemorates the event described in the following popular legend:Many years ago there lived in the village a Countess Margaretha(according to others her name was Mathilde), wife of Count Hermann ofHenneberg. Sometimes she is referred to simply as the Countess of Holland.One day a poor woman carrying twins in her arms approached her and askedfor charity. The countess scolded her, saying, "Get away, you shamelessbeggar! It is impossible for a woman to have two children at once fromjust one father!"The poor woman replied, "Then may God let you have as many children asthere are days in the year!" Some time later the countess became pregnantand on one day gave birth to 365 children. This happened in the year 1270(1276), in the countess's forty third year. These children were allbaptized alive by Guido, the Bishop of Utrecht, in two bronze fonts. Allthe boys were named Johannes and the girls Elizabeth. However, within oneday they all died, together with their mother, and all lie buried in onegrave in the village church.It is said that there is also a monument to this event in the church atDelft.
