'Let us drink to your triumph.'He cast a lingering glance at the little Princess, and withouthesitation lifted the cup.'Don't drink!' suddenly cried out the little Princess. 'I would rathermarry a gardener.'And she burst into tears.Michael flung the contents of the cup behind him, sprang over the table,and fell at Lina's feet.
