future Buddha was born one of a peasant family. and when he grew up,he gained his living by tilling the ground.At that time a hawker used to go from place to place, trafficking ingoods carried by an ass. Now at each place he came to, when he tookthe pack down from the ass's back, he used to clothe him in a lion'sskin, and turn him loose in the rice and barley fields. And when thewatchmen in the fields saw the ass, they dared not go near him, takinghim for a lion.So one day the hawker stopped in a village. and whilst he was gettinghis own breakfast cooked, he dressed the ass in a lion's skin, andturned him loose in a barley field. The watchmen in the field darednot go up to him. but going home, they published the news. Then allthe villagers came out with weapons in their hands. and blowingchanks, and beating drums, they went near the field and shouted.Terrified with the fear of death, the ass uttered a cry the bray ofan ass!And when he knew him then to be an ass, the future Buddha pronouncedthe First Verse:"This is not a lion's roaring,Nor a tiger's, nor a panther's.Dressed in a lion's skin,'Tis a wretched ass that roars!"But when the villagers knew the creature to be an ass, they beat himtill his bones broke. and, carrying off the lion's skin, went away.Then the hawker came. and seeing the ass fallen into so bad a plight,pronounced the Second Verse:"Long might the ass,Clad in a lion's skin,Have fed on the barley green.But he brayed!And that moment he came to ruin."And even whilst he was yet speaking the ass died on the spot!
