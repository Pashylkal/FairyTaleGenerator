In the city of Aleppo there was a king. As mice abounded in that city,the people complained of them every day. One day, while the king wasconversing with Avicenna, they touched upon the mice. The king said, "OAvicenna, everyone complains of these mice. Would that we could find someremedy for them that everyone might be at ease."Avicenna answered, "I will make it happen that not a single one of themremain in this city. But with this condition, that you stand at the citygate, and beware, whatever wonder you see, that you not laugh."The king consented and was glad. Straightway he ordered that theyprepare his horse, and he mounted and went to the gate.Avicenna, on his part, stood in a street and repeated a charm andcalled the mice. One of the mice came, and he caught it and killed it andput it in a coffin and made four mice bear that coffin. Then he repeatedthe charm and began to strike his hands one against the other. and thesefour mice began to march slowly along. And all the mice that were in thecity attended that funeral, so that the streets were filled full of them.They came to the gate where the king was standing, some of them before thecoffin and some of them behind. And while the king was looking on, he sawthese mice with the coffin on their shoulders, and, unable to resist, helaughed. As soon as he laughed, the mice that were outside the gate alldied, but those that were within the gate dispersed and ran offinside.Avicenna said, "O king, if you had kept my counsel and not laughed, nota single mouse would have remained in this city, but all of them wouldhave gone out and died. And everyone would have been at ease."And the king repented of his having laughed. But what could he do?Repentance too late profits not.
