Long ago, the mice held a general council to consider what measuresthey could take to outwit their common enemy, the cat. Some said this, andsome said that. but at last a young mouse got up and said he had aproposal to make, which he though would meet the case."You will all agree," said he, "that our chief danger consists in thesly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if wecould receive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape fromher. I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, andattached by a ribbon round the neck of the cat. By this means we shouldalways know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was inthe neighborhood."This proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse got up andsaid, "That is all very well, but who is to bell the cat?"The mice looked at one another and nobody spoke. Then the old mousesaid: " It is easy to propose impossible remedies ."
