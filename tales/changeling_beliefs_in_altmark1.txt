Folk Legends from AltmarkTo prevent the "thickheads" (underground spirits) from exchanging anewborn child, it must be continuously watched until it is baptized. Forthis reason the baptism takes place as soon as possible.Dwarfs in the region between Salzwedel and Disdorf are not called"thickheads," but rather "the underground people." Here the belief that achild can be exchanged is especially strong. People fear that themisshapen dwarfs who live beneath the earth, and who would like nothingmore than to have beautiful, well formed human children, will stealnewborns, leaving their own malformed children, called changelings, intheir place. Therefore there is always a great rush to have the childbaptized, and until this happens the mother and child will not be leftalone for even an instant. Furthermore, until then there must always be aburning light near them, even in broad daylight, because the undergroundpeople are afraid of light.A child must carefully and continuously be protected against exchangeby the underground people until it is baptized. Therefore the so called"word of God," a leaf from the Bible from a hymnbook, is either wrapped upwith the child in its blanket or laid in its cradle.
