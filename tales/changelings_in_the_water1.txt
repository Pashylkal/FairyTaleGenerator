German LegendsNear Halberstadt a peasant had a killcrop that sucked its mother and fivewet nurses dry, all the while eating voraciously (for they eat more thanten other children). It behaved in such a manner that they became tiredof it. The peasant was advised that he should take the child on apilgrimage in praise of the Virgin Mary to Heckelstadt and have himweighed at that place.The good peasant followed this advice. He put the child in a pack basketand set forth carrying it on his back. He was about to cross over astream on a bridge when he heard a shout from the water beneath him:"Killcrop! Killcrop!"The child in the basket, who had until now never spoken a word, answered:"Ho! Ho!" The peasant did not expect this, and it startled him.Then the devil in the water asked further: "Where are you going?"The killcrop above answered "I am going to Heckelstadt to our Dear Lady,and have myself weighed, that I might thrive."When the peasant heard that the changeling could talk perfectly well, hebecame angry and threw him, together with the basket, into the water.Then the two devils came together, cried out "Ho! Ho! Ha!" andfrolicked and jousted with one another, and then disappeared.
