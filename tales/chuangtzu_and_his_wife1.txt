Chuang tzu saw a young woman in mourning vigorously fanning a newlymade grave. On his asking her the reason of this strange conduct, shereplied, "I am doing this because my husband begged me to wait until theearth on his tomb was dry before I remarried!"Chuang tzu offered to help her, and as soon as he waved the fan once,the earth was dry. The young widow thanked him and departed.On his return home, Chuang tzu related this incident to his wife. Sheexpressed astonishment at such conduct on the part of a wife."There's nothing to be surprised at," rejoined the husband. "That's howthings go in this world."Seeing that he was poking fun at her, she protested angrily.Some time after this Chuang tzu died. His wife, much grieved, buriedhim.A few days later a young man named Chu Wang sun arrived with theintention, as he said, of placing himself under the instruction ofChuang tzu. When he heard that he was dead he went and performedprostrations before his tomb, and afterward took up his abode in an emptyroom saying that he wished to study.After half a month had elapsed, the widow asked an old servant who hadaccompanied Wang sun if the young man was married. On his replying in thenegative, she requested the old servant to propose a match between them.Wang sun made some objections, saying that people would criticize theirconduct."Since my husband is dead, what can they say?" replied the widow. Shethen put off her mourning garments and prepared for the wedding.Wang sun took her to the grave of her husband, and said to her, "Thegentleman has returned to life!"She looked at Wang sun and recognized the features of her husband. Shewas so overwhelmed with shame that she hanged herself. Chuang tzu buriedher in an empty tomb.
