When Dr. Faust was in Heilbronn, performing his troublesome artsthroughout the region, he often went to Boxberg Castle, where he wasalways courteously received.Once he was there on a cold winter's day, strolling with the lords andladies of the palace along the garden paths on the east side of thecastle. The ladies complained about the frost, and he immediately causedthe sun to shine warmly, the snow covered ground to turn green, and a massof violets and beautiful flowers of every kind to spring forth. Then athis command the trees blossomed, and   following the desires of the group  apples, plums, peaches, and other good fruit ripened on the branches.Finally he caused grape vines to grow and bear grapes. He then invitedeach of his companions to cut off a grape, but not before he gave thesignal to do so. When all of them were ready to cut away he removed thedeception from their eyes, and each one saw that he was holding a knifeagainst the nose of the person next to him. The part of the garden wherethis took place has ever since been called "the violet garden."Another time Faust left Boxberg Castle at a quarter past eleven inorder to be at a banquet in Heilbronn at the last strike of twelveo'clock. He got into his carriage hitched to four black horses and droveaway like the wind, and he did indeed arrive in Heilbronn punctually atthe strike of twelve.A man working in a field saw how horned spirits paved the way beforethe carriage, while others pulled up the paving stones from behind andcarried them away, thus destroying every trace of the pavement.
