Druidical circles and monoliths were looked upon with awe. and there werefew that would have dared to remove them.Here is a tradition of a monolith on the farm of Achorrachin inGlenlivet. The farmer was building a steading, and took the stone as alintel to a byre door. Disease fell upon the cattle, and most unearthlynoises were heard during the night all round the steading. There was nopeace for man or beast.By the advice of a friend, the stone was taken from the wall and throwninto the river that ran past the farm. Still there was no peace. Thestone was at last put into its old place in the middle of a field.Things then returned to their usual course.The stone stands to the present day in the middle of the field, and insome of its crevices were seen, not many years ago, small pieces ofmortar.
