Once upon a time a man and his son went on a visit to theson's father in law. They were welcomed in a friendly way.but the father in law was much put out at the unexpected visitas he had nothing ready for the entertainment of his guests. Hetook an opportunity to go into the house and said to one of hisdaughters in law. "Now, my girl, fill the little river and the bigriver while I am away. and polish the big axe and the little axe anddig out five or six channels, and put hobbles on these relations whohave come to visit us and bar them into the cow house. I am going tobathe and will come back with a pot full of the water of dry land,then we will finish off these friends."The two visitors outside overheard this strange talk and began towonder what it meant. They did not like the talk about axes and diggingchannels, it sounded as if their host meant to kill them as a sacrificeand bury their bodies in a river bed. rich men had been known to dosuch things. With this thought in their minds they got up and beganto run away as fast as their legs could carry them. But when the youngwoman saw what they were doing she ran after them and called them back.They reluctantly stopped to hear what she had to say. and when she cameup they reproached her for not having warned them of the fate in storefor them. But she only laughed at their folly and explained that whather father in law meant was that she should wash their feet and givethem a seat in the cow house. and make ready two pots of rice beer andpolish the big and little brass basins and make five or six leaf cupsand he would bring back some liquor and they would all have a drink. Atthis explanation they had a hearty laugh and went back to the house.
