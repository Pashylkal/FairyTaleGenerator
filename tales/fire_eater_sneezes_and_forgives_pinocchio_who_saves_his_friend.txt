Harlequin, from death.In the theater, great excitement reigned.Fire Eater (this was really his name) was very ugly, but he was far frombeing as bad as he looked. Proof of this is that, when he saw the poorMarionette being brought in to him, struggling with fear and crying, "Idon't want to die! I don't want to die!" he felt sorry for him and beganfirst to waver and then to weaken. Finally, he could control himself nolonger and gave a loud sneeze.At that sneeze, Harlequin, who until then had been as sad as a weepingwillow, smiled happily and leaning toward the Marionette, whispered tohim:"Good news, brother mine! Fire Eater has sneezed and this is a sign thathe feels sorry for you. You are saved!"For be it known, that, while other people, when sad and sorrowful, weepand wipe their eyes, Fire Eater, on the other hand, had the strangehabit of sneezing each time he felt unhappy. The way was just as good asany other to show the kindness of his heart.After sneezing, Fire Eater, ugly as ever, cried to Pinocchio:"Stop crying! Your wails give me a funny feeling down here in my stomachand E tchee! E tchee!" Two loud sneezes finished his speech."God bless you!" said Pinocchio."Thanks! Are your father and mother still living?" demanded Fire Eater."My father, yes. My mother I have never known.""Your poor father would suffer terribly if I were to use you asfirewood. Poor old man! I feel sorry for him! E tchee! E tchee!E tchee!" Three more sneezes sounded, louder than ever."God bless you!" said Pinocchio."Thanks! However, I ought to be sorry for myself, too, just now. My gooddinner is spoiled. I have no more wood for the fire, and the lambis only half cooked. Never mind! In your place I'll burn some otherMarionette. Hey there! Officers!"At the call, two wooden officers appeared, long and thin as a yard ofrope, with queer hats on their heads and swords in their hands.Fire Eater yelled at them in a hoarse voice:"Take Harlequin, tie him, and throw him on the fire. I want my lamb welldone!"Think how poor Harlequin felt! He was so scared that his legs doubled upunder him and he fell to the floor.Pinocchio, at that heartbreaking sight, threw himself at the feet ofFire Eater and, weeping bitterly, asked in a pitiful voice which couldscarcely be heard:"Have pity, I beg of you, signore!""There are no signori here!""Have pity, kind sir!""There are no sirs here!""Have pity, your Excellency!"On hearing himself addressed as your Excellency, the Director of theMarionette Theater sat up very straight in his chair, stroked his longbeard, and becoming suddenly kind and compassionate, smiled proudly ashe said to Pinocchio:"Well, what do you want from me now, Marionette?""I beg for mercy for my poor friend, Harlequin, who has never done theleast harm in his life.""There is no mercy here, Pinocchio. I have spared you. Harlequin mustburn in your place. I am hungry and my dinner must be cooked.""In that case," said Pinocchio proudly, as he stood up and flung awayhis cap of dough, "in that case, my duty is clear. Come, officers!Tie me up and throw me on those flames. No, it is not fair for poorHarlequin, the best friend that I have in the world, to die in myplace!"These brave words, said in a piercing voice, made all the otherMarionettes cry. Even the officers, who were made of wood also, criedlike two babies.Fire Eater at first remained hard and cold as a piece of ice. but then,little by little, he softened and began to sneeze. And after four orfive sneezes, he opened wide his arms and said to Pinocchio:"You are a brave boy! Come to my arms and kiss me!"Pinocchio ran to him and scurrying like a squirrel up the long blackbeard, he gave Fire Eater a loving kiss on the tip of his nose."Has pardon been granted to me?" asked poor Harlequin with a voice thatwas hardly a breath."Pardon is yours!" answered Fire Eater. and sighing and wagging hishead, he added: "Well, tonight I shall have to eat my lamb only halfcooked, but beware the next time, Marionettes."At the news that pardon had been given, the Marionettes ran to the stageand, turning on all the lights, they danced and sang till dawn.
