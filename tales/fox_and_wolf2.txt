A fox and a wolf found an old horse in a mire. They wanted to take itwith them and asked one another how they might manage.The fox said, "You are the strongest. Tie the horse's tail around yourbody and pull, while I prod the horse with a stick."That happened, and soon the horse was out of the mud, but it then ranoff with the wolf tied to its tail."Claw your paws into the ground!" cried the fox."But I can see neither heaven nor earth!" answered the wolf.Finally the wolf succeeded in breaking loose, and he and the foxcontinued on their way, but without the horse.
