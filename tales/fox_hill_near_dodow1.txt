In the village of Dodow near Wittenburg there lived an old woman whopossessed a fox strap. With its help she could transform herself into afox, and thus her table never lacked for geese, ducks, and all kinds ofpoultry.Her grandchild knew about it, and one day when the schoolmaster wastalking about magic in the school, the child told about the fox strap, andthe next day brought it to school.The schoolmaster took it into his hand and unintentionally approached hishead with it. Suddenly he was standing before the children, transformedinto a fox. They broke out with a deafening noise. This so frightenedthe little schoolmaster that he jumped out the window with a singleleap.He ran to the hill that lay near the village and there built himself aden.One day a great hunt was organized, and our fox was among those pursued bythe huntsmen. A bullet hit him, and suddenly a schoolmaster was lyingthere before the bewildered huntsman. The bullet had struck the fox strapand ripped it apart.In memory of this event the people of Dodow gave the name Fox Hill to theplace where their schoolmaster had lived.
