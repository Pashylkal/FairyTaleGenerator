that wept and laughed like a child.Centuries ago there lived "A king!" my little readers will say immediately.No, children, you are mistaken. Once upon a time there was a piece ofwood. It was not an expensive piece of wood. Far from it. Just a commonblock of firewood, one of those thick, solid logs that are put on thefire in winter to make cold rooms cozy and warm.I do not know how this really happened, yet the fact remains thatone fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an oldcarpenter. His real name was Mastro Antonio, but everyone called himMastro Cherry, for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shinythat it looked like a ripe cherry.As soon as he saw that piece of wood, Mastro Cherry was filled with joy.Rubbing his hands together happily, he mumbled half to himself:"This has come in the nick of time. I shall use it to make the leg of atable."He grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood.But as he was about to give it the first blow, he stood still with armuplifted, for he had heard a wee, little voice say in a beseeching tone:"Please be careful! Do not hit me so hard!"What a look of surprise shone on Mastro Cherry's face! His funny facebecame still funnier.He turned frightened eyes about the room to find out where that wee,little voice had come from and he saw no one! He looked under thebench no one! He peeped inside the closet no one! He searched amongthe shavings no one! He opened the door to look up and down thestreet and still no one!"Oh, I see!" he then said, laughing and scratching his Wig. "It caneasily be seen that I only thought I heard the tiny voice say the words!Well, well to work once more."He struck a most solemn blow upon the piece of wood."Oh, oh! You hurt!" cried the same far away little voice.Mastro Cherry grew dumb, his eyes popped out of his head, his mouthopened wide, and his tongue hung down on his chin.As soon as he regained the use of his senses, he said, trembling andstuttering from fright:"Where did that voice come from, when there is no one around? Might itbe that this piece of wood has learned to weep and cry like a child? Ican hardly believe it. Here it is a piece of common firewood, goodonly to burn in the stove, the same as any other. Yet might someone behidden in it? If so, the worse for him. I'll fix him!"With these words, he grabbed the log with both hands and started toknock it about unmercifully. He threw it to the floor, against the wallsof the room, and even up to the ceiling.He listened for the tiny voice to moan and cry. He waited twominutes nothing. five minutes nothing. ten minutes nothing."Oh, I see," he said, trying bravely to laugh and ruffling up his wigwith his hand. "It can easily be seen I only imagined I heard the tinyvoice! Well, well to work once more!"The poor fellow was scared half to death, so he tried to sing a gay songin order to gain courage.He set aside the hatchet and picked up the plane to make the wood smoothand even, but as he drew it to and fro, he heard the same tiny voice.This time it giggled as it spoke:"Stop it! Oh, stop it! Ha, ha, ha! You tickle my stomach."This time poor Mastro Cherry fell as if shot. When he opened his eyes,he found himself sitting on the floor.His face had changed. fright had turned even the tip of his nose fromred to deepest purple.
