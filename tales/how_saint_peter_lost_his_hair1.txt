Everyone knows that Saint Peter is entirely bald, except for a singlelock of hair in front that falls over his forehead, but most people do notknow the following story that explains how this came to be.While he and Christ were traveling together they came to a farmhousewhere the farmwife was just cooking up some large yeast pancakes ingrease. According to others it was noodles.Saint Peter entered the house to beg for some pancakes, while the Lordwaited outside. The farmwife was a good hearted woman, and she gave Peterthree pancakes, fresh from the pan. But Peter was selfish, and in orderto gain an advantage when the pancakes were divided up, he quickly hid oneof them in his cap, then put it on his head. He pretended that he hadreceived only two pancakes, one of which he gave to the Lord.The pancake under his cap was still hot, and it began to burn Peterterribly on the head, but he could not do anything about it. he just hadto bear the pain.Later, when he took off his cap, he discovered that the hot pancake hadburned into his head a large bald spot, which remained with him as long ashe lived. Only the lock of hair that had protruded from the front of hiscap was spared. Thus Saint Peter's bald head has one lock of hair infront.
