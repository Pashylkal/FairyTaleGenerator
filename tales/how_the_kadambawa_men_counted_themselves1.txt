Twelve Kadambawa men cut fence sticks, tied them into twelve bundles,then set them upright and leaned them together. Then one of the men said,"Are our men all here? We must count and see."So a man counted them, but he counted only eleven men, omittinghimself. "There are only eleven men, but there are twelve bundles of fencesticks," he said.Then another man said, "Maybe you have made a mistake," and countedthem again in the same way. "There are eleven men and twelve bundles offence sticks. There is a man missing," they said, and they went into thejungle to look for him.While they were in the jungle looking, a man from another village heardthem shouting. He came to them and asked why they were shouting.The men said, "Twelve of our men came to cut fence sticks. There aretwelve bundles of sticks but only eleven men. One man is missing."This man saw that there were twelve men, so he said, "Let each of youpick up your own bundle of fence sticks."So each of the twelve men picked up his own bundle of sticks, and thusthey all returned to their village.
