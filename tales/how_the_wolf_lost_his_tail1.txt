One day the wolf and the fox were out together, and they stole a dish ofcrowdie. Now the wolf was the biggest beast of the two, and he had a longtail like a greyhound, and great teeth.The fox was afraid of him, and did not dare to say a word when the wolfate the most of the crowdie, and left only a little at the bottom of thedish for him, but he determined to punish him for it. so the next nightwhen they were out together the fox said, "I smell a very nice cheese, and(pointing to the moonshine on the ice) there it is too.""And how will you get it?" said the wolf."Well, stop you here till I see if the farmer is asleep, and if you keepyour tail on it, nobody will see you or know that it is there. Keep itsteady. I may be some time coming back."So the wolf lay down and laid his tail on the moonshine in the ice, andkept it for an hour till it was fast.Then the fox, who had been watching him, ran in to the farmer and said,"The wolf is there. he will eat up the children   the wolf! the wolf!"Then the farmer and his wife came out with sticks to kill the wolf, butthe wolf ran off leaving his tail behind him, and that's why the wolf isstumpy tailed to this day, though the fox has a long brush.
