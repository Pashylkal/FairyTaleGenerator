ApprenticeIt was mid winter when Till Eulenspiegel arrived at Ascherleben. Timeswere hard, but finally he found a furrier who was willing to take on anapprentice, and he was put to work sewing pelts. Not being accustomed tothe smell of the curing hides, he said, "Pew! Pew! You are as white aschalk, but stink like dung!"The furrier said, "If you don't like the smell, then why are you afurrier's apprentice? It's a natural smell. It's only wool."Eulenspiegel said nothing, but thought, "One bad thing can drive anotherbad thing away." Then he let such a sour fart that the furrier and hiswife had to stop working.The furrier said, "If you have to fart like that, then go out into thecourtyard. There you can fart as much as you like."Eulenspiegel answered, "A fart is more natural and healthier than thestench of your sheep pelts."The furrier said, "Healthy or not, if you want to fart, then gooutside."Eulenspiegel said, "Master, it would do no good, because farts don't likethe cold. They are used to being in a warm place. That's why if you leta fart it always rushes for your nose. It goes from one warm place toanother."The furrier said nothing, for he could see that Eulenspiegel knew nothingof the furrier trade and was a rogue at that. And he sent him on hisway.
