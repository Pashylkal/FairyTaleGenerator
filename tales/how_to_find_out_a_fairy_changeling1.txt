Notes on the Folk Lore of the North East ofScotlandIf the child became cross and began to dwine (waste away), fearsimmediately arose that it might be a "fairy changeling," and the trial byfire was put into operation. The hearth was piled with peat, and whenthe fire was at its strength the suspected changeling was placed in frontof it and as near as possible not to be scorched, or it was suspended ina basket over the fire. If it was a "changeling child" it made itsescape by the lum (chimney) throwing back word of scorn as itdisappeared.One mode of bringing back the true child was the following. A newskull (an oblong basket) was taken and hung over the fire from apiece of a branch of a hazel tree, and into this basket the suspectedchangeling was laid. Careful watch was kept till it screamed. If itscreamed it was a changeling, and it was held fast to prevent itsescape. When an opportunity occurred, it was carried to a place wherefour roads met, and a dead body was carried over it. The true child wasrestored.
