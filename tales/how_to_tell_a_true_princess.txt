There was once upon a time a Prince who wanted to marry a Princess, butshe must be a true Princess. So he travelled through the whole world tofind one, but there was always something against each. There were plentyof Princesses, but he could not find out if they were true Princesses.In every case there was some little defect, which showed the genuinearticle was not yet found. So he came home again in very low spirits,for he had wanted very much to have a true Princess. One night there wasa dreadful storm. it thundered and lightened and the rain streamed downin torrents. It was fearful! There was a knocking heard at the Palacegate, and the old King went to open it.There stood a Princess outside the gate. but oh, in what a sad plightshe was from the rain and the storm! The water was running down fromher hair and her dress into the points of her shoes and out at the heelsagain. And yet she said she was a true Princess!'Well, we shall soon find that!' thought the old Queen. But she saidnothing, and went into the sleeping room, took off all the bed clothes,and laid a pea on the bottom of the bed. Then she put twenty mattresseson top of the pea, and twenty eider down quilts on the top of themattresses. And this was the bed in which the Princess was to sleep.The next morning she was asked how she had slept.'Oh, very badly!' said the Princess. 'I scarcely closed my eyes allnight! I am sure I don't know what was in the bed. I laid on somethingso hard that my whole body is black and blue. It is dreadful!'Now they perceived that she was a true Princess, because she had feltthe pea through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider down quilts.No one but a true Princess could be so sensitive.So the Prince married her, for now he knew that at last he had got holdof a true Princess. And the pea was put into the Royal Museum, where itis still to be seen if no one has stolen it. Now this is a true story.
