castle of Beloeil twelve princesses of wonderful beauty, and as proud asthey were beautiful, and who were besides so very sensitive and of suchtruly royal blood, that they would have felt at once the presence of apea in their beds, even if the mattresses had been laid over it.It was whispered about that they led exactly the lives that princessesought to lead, sleeping far into the morning, and never getting up tillmid day. They had twelve beds all in the same room, but what was veryextraordinary was the fact that though they were locked in by triplebolts, every morning their satin shoes were found worn into holes.When they were asked what they had been doing all night, they alwaysanswered that they had been asleep. and, indeed, no noise was ever heardin the room, yet the shoes could not wear themselves out alone!At last the Duke of Beloeil ordered the trumpet to be sounded, and aproclamation to be made that whoever could discover how his daughterswore out their shoes should choose one of them for his wife.On hearing the proclamation a number of princes arrived at the castleto try their luck. They watched all night behind the open door of theprincesses, but when the morning came they had all disappeared, and noone could tell what had become of them.
