One day Jack took the devil into a field of wheat, when it was springingup. He said, "Which will you have, the tops or the butts?"There was not much top to be seen, so the devil said he's have the butts.At harvest time Jack accordingly had the wheat, the devil the straw.Naturally he grumbled a good deal over such a bad bargain.Next year the field was sown with turnip seed, and Jack said, "You shallhave tops this time."The devil agreed to this, and in due time Jack had the turnips, leavinghis partner the green tops.After that they went to mow a field of grass, each one to have all the hayhe could cut. They were to begin together in the morning. Jack got up inthe night and put harrow tines in the grass on the side of the meadowwhere the devil was to mow.In the morning these notched and blunted the scythe, which was continuallycatching in them. but the "Old 'Un," thinking they were only burdocks,kept muttering, "Burdock, Jack! Burdock Jack!"Jack took no notice, and, mowing away diligently, secured nearly all thecrop for himself once more.Then they went to threshing. Jack was to have bottoms this time, so he gotthe barn floor, and the devil went on top. He put up a hurdle (gate) forthe devil to thresh on, and as he battered away Jack collected the corn(grain) on the floor.
