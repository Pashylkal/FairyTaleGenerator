When Johha grew old enough to work for his living he became a donkeydriver. One day, being in charge of twelvedonkeys employed to carry earth to the city, it occurred to him, beforestarting with the laden animals, to count them. Finding thetale (tally) complete, he took them to their destination and unloadedthem.He then mounted one of them, and was going to return when he found onedonkey missing. At once dismounting, he putthem all in a row, and was astonished and greatly relieved to find thetwelve there. He thereupon remounted and set off again,wondering as he rode along how it was that he had missed one donkey.Suddenly the suspicion flashed upon him that possiblythe second count had been faulty, so he counted again, to find once morethat only eleven were racing along in front of him.Terribly disconcerted, he again got down off the creature he was ridingand, stopping the others, once more counted them. Hewas puzzled to find that there were again twelve.So absorbed was he by this mystery, that he went on counting andrecounting the donkeys till his master, surprised at his long absence, came and solved his difficulty by obliging him to follow hisasses on foot.
