German LegendsA reliable citizen of Leipzig told the following story: When his firstchild was a few weeks old they found it on three different nights lyingcrossways and uncovered in its cradle, even though the cradle stoodimmediately next to the mother's bed. The father therefore resolved tostay awake during the third night and to pay close attention to hischild. He persisted a long while, staying awake until after midnight.Nothing happened to the child, because he had been keeping a watchful eyeon it. But then his eyes began to close a little. Shortly afterward themother woke up and saw that the child was again lying crossways, and thatthe cover had been taken from the cradle and thrown across the middle ofher bed. In keeping with common custom, she normally folded the coverback at the foot of the cradle. Everything had happened so fast thateveryone was amazed. However, the demon did not seem to have had anyfurther power over the child.
