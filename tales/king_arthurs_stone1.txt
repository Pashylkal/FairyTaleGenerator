In the western part of Cornwall, all the marks of any peculiar kind foundon the rocks are referred either to the giants or the devil. In theeastern part of the county such markings are almost always attributed toArthur.Not far from the Devil's Coit in St. Columb, on the edge of the Gossmoor,there is a large stone upon which are deeply impressed marks, which alittle fancy may convert into the marks of four horseshoes. This is "KingArthur's Stone," and these marks were made by the horse upon which theBritish king rode when he resided at Castle Denis, and hunted on thesemoors. King Arthur's bed, and chair, and caves, are frequently to be metwith.The Giant's Coits,   and many traditions of these will be found in thesection devoted to the giant romances   are probably monuments of theearliest types of rock mythology. Those of Arthur belong to the periodwhen the Britons were so far advanced in civilization as to war underexperienced rulers. and those which are appropriated by the devil areevidently instances of the influence of priestcraft (Roman Catholicism) onthe minds of an impressible people.
