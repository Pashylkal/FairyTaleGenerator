Between Werl and Soest there lived a man whose name was Knoist, and hehad three sons. One was blind, the other lame, and the third stark naked.Once they were walking across a field, where they saw a hare. The blindone shot it, the lame one caught it, and the naked one put it in hispocket. Then they came to a tremendously large body of water, on whichthere were three ships. One leaked, one sank, the third had no bottom init. All three got into the one with no bottom. Then they came to atremendously large forest in which there was a tremendously large tree. Inthe tree was a tremendously large chapel. In the chapel was a sexton ofhornbeam wood and a parson of boxwood, who were passing out holy waterwith cudgels.Blessed is heWho from this holy water can flee.
