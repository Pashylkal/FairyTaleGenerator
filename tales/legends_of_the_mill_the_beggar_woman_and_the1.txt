FairyMy grandmother used to tell a story about a mill goblin somewhere up inthe country, where no one could get anything ground at the mill, it was sobewitched. But one evening came a beggar woman, who badly wanted to get alittle corn ground, and she asked if she could not get leave to stay therefor the night and do it."Oh, dear no!" said the owner of the mill. "you can't stay there at night.neither you nor the mill would have any peace for the goblin."But the beggar woman wanted so badly to get her corn ground, for she hadnot a spoonful of meal to make either soup or porridge for the children athome. Well, at last she got leave to go into the mill and grind her cornat night. When she came there, she made a fire on the hearth, where a bigpot of tar was hanging. She started the mill, and sat down by the hearthwith her knitting.In a while a girl came into the mill and said "Good evening" to her."Good evening," answered the beggar woman, and went on with her knitting.But very soon the strange girl began raking the fire out over the hearth,but the beggar woman raked it together again."What's your name?: said the fairy, as you already will have guessed thatthe strange girl was."My name is Self!" answered the beggar woman."The girl thought that was a strange name, and began raking the fire aboutagain. This made the beggar woman angry, and she began scolding and rakingthe fire together. They were thus employed for some time, when thebeggar woman, watching her opportunity, upset the boiling tar over thegirl, who began screaming and screeching, and as she ran out of the mill,she cried, "Father, father, Self has burnt me!""Well, if you have burnt yourself, you have only yourself to blame," saida voice in the hill.
