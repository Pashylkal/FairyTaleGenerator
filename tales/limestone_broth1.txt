The making of "limestone broth" was a device employed by wandering beggarsto secure a good supper without seeming to ask for it. The beggar, makinghis way into one of the cabins which had always their doors hospitablyopen for poor vagrants would ask the vanithee (or woman of thehouse) to lend him a small pot, and allow him to cook his supper upon herfire. Permission was, of course, granted, and the pot was produced.He then took from his wallet two substantial pieces of freshly cutlimestone, which he placed in the pot, and, covering them with water, putthe pot upon the fire to boil.The vanithee , looking on with interest, exclaimed, "What are yezgoin' to make, me good man?""Limestone broth, ma'am," replied the beggar."Glory be to God, look at that now!" exclaimed the amazed housewife. Whenthe boiling had proceeded for some time the beggar man tasted thecontents, and remarked "it would be grately improved by a pinch o' salt."The "pinch o' salt " was given him, and by and by he suggested that allthe "broth" wanted was just a couple of spoonfuls of "male" to thicken it.Next came a request for a few slices of turnips, potatoes, and onions, togive it a little substance, all of which the good woman, who continuedwatching the proceedings with the keenest interest, kindly supplied. nordid she refuse "a knuckle of bacon," just to give the broth "the lastetaste in the world of the flavour of mate."And when, at the conclusion of the operation, she was invited to try the"limestone broth," she pronounced it "quite as good as any mate broth sheever tasted in her life."
