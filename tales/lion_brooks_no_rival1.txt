So finally it came the rabbit's turnto go in. He was one of the wisest animals of that time. He wassupposed to be there at twelve o'clock. He came hoppin' along theroad, stoppin' everywhere, lookin' at everything, until it threw him off time. Wonders, whey he goin', what could he do to keep the lion fromgettin' so angry with him.So finally he came across a well. Thethought came to him as he looked into the well, he saw his shader, hehad a scheme to fool the lion. He had been told by the other animalsthat any way he could get rid of the lion, they would pay him, givehim praise of being the wisest animal of the forest.He entered thelion's room pretendin' he had been runnin', doin' all he could to getthere on time.The lion asked him why he was so late.The rabbitbegan to tell him the story why he was so late. So he tol' the lion,if he didn' believe what he had tol' him, to follow him, and hewould show him.So the lion went with the rabbit to the well. Therabbit tol' the lion to get up on the curb of the well and look down intothe well, and he would see what had delayed him. So he did.Whenhe looked into the water, he saw another face, not knowing that it washimself. He frowned, he grit his teeth, and the other lion did the samething.
