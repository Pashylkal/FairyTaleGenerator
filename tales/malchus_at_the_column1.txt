Malchus was the head of the Jews who killed our Lord. The Lordpardoned them all, and likewise the good thief, but he never pardonedMalchus, because it was he who gave the Madonna a blow.He is confined under a mountain, and condemned to walk around a column,without resting, as long as the world lasts. Every time that he walksabout the column he gives it a blow in memory of the blow he gave themother of our Lord. He has walked around the column so long that he hassunk into the ground. He is now up to his neck. When he is under, headand all, the world will come to an end, and God will then send him to theplace prepared for him. He asks all those who go to see him (for thereare such) whether children are yet born. and when they say yes, he gives adeep sigh and resumes his walk, saying: "The time is not yet!" for beforethe world comes to an end there will be no children born for sevenyears.
