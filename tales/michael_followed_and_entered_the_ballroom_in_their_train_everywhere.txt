were mirrors, lights, flowers, and damask hangings.The Star Gazer was quite bewildered at the magnificence of the sight.He placed himself out of the way in a corner, admiring the grace andbeauty of the princesses. Their loveliness was of every kind. Some werefair and some were dark. some had chestnut hair, or curls darker still,and some had golden locks. Never were so many beautiful princesses seentogether at one time, but the one whom the cow boy thought the mostbeautiful and the most fascinating was the little Princess with thevelvet eyes.With what eagerness she danced! leaning on her partner's shoulder sheswept by like a whirlwind. Her cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkled, and itwas plain that she loved dancing better than anything else.The poor boy envied those handsome young men with whom she danced sogracefully, but he did not know how little reason he had to be jealousof them.The young men were really the princes who, to the number of fifty atleast, had tried to steal the princesses' secret. The princesses hadmade them drink something of a philtre, which froze the heart and leftnothing but the love of dancing.
