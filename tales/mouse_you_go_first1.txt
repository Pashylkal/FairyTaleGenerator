A mouse and a coal once went walking together. They came to a brook andwanted to get across, but there was neither a bridge nor a walkway, butonly a piece of straw lying nearby. They would have to walk across thestraw, if they wanted to get to the other side.Then the coal said to the mouse, "You go first! You can jump betterthan I can."But the mouse said, "No, you cross first. You must light the way forme."In the end, after they had quarreled enough, the coal went on ahead,but when he got to the middle of the brook, the straw caught fire andburned in two. The coal fell into the water and died, just like coalsalways die when they fall into water. In his fear he cried out. "Hsssss,"he said.When the mouse saw and heard this, he began to laugh, and he laughedand laughed until he split his fur coat. His joy in someone else'smisfortune did not do him any good!"What can I do now?" he thought. "I must see how I can mend my coat."Then the mouse went to the shoemaker and said, "Give me some thread, soI can mend my coat."The shoemaker said, "If you will bring me some bristles, I will giveyou some thread, so you can mend your coat."Then the mouse went to the sow and said, "Give me some bristles, so Ican take the bristles to the shoemaker, so the shoemaker will give me somethread, so I can mend my coat."The sow said, "Give me some bran, then I will give you some bristles,so you can take the bristles to the shoemaker, so the shoemaker will giveyou some thread, so you can mend your coat."Then the mouse went to the miller and said, "Give me some bran, so Ican take the bran to the sow, so the sow will give me some bristles, so Ican take the bristles to the shoemaker, so the shoemaker will give me somethread, so I can mend my coat."The miller said, "Give me some grain, then I will give you some bran,so you can take the bran to the sow, so the sow will give you somebristles, so you can take the bristles to the shoemaker, so the shoemakerwill give you some thread, so you can mend your coat."Then the mouse went to the field and said, "Give me some grain, so Ican take the grain to the miller, so the miller will give me some bran, soI can take the bran to the sow, so the sow will give me some bristles, soI can take the bristles to the shoemaker, so the shoemaker will give mesome thread, so I can mend my coat."The field said, "Give me some manure, then I will give you some grain,so you can take the grain to the miller, so the miller will give you somebran, so you can take the bran to the sow, so the sow will give you somebristles, so you can take the bristles to the shoemaker, so the shoemakerwill give you some thread, so you can mend your coat."Then the mouse went to the cow and said, "Give me some manure, so I cantake the manure to the field, so the field will give me some grain, so Ican take the grain to the miller, so the miller will give me some bran, soI can take the bran to the sow, so the sow will give me some bristles, soI can take the bristles to the shoemaker, so the shoemaker will give mesome thread, so I can mend my coat."The cow said, "Give me some grass, then I will give you some manure, soyou can take the manure to the field, so the field will give you somegrain, so you can take the grain to the miller, so the miller will giveyou some bran, so you can take the bran to the sow, so the sow will giveyou some bristles, so you can take the bristles to the shoemaker, so theshoemaker will give you some thread, so you can mend your coat."Then the mouse went to the meadow and said, "Give me some grass, so Ican take the grass to the cow, so the cow will give me some manure, so Ican take the manure to the field, so the field will give me some grain, soI can take the grain to the miller, so the miller will give me some bran,so I can take the bran to the sow, so the sow will give me some bristles,so I can take the bristles to the shoemaker, so the shoemaker will give mesome thread, so I can mend my coat."The meadow said, "Give me some water, then I will give you some grass,so you can take the grass to the cow, so the cow will give you somemanure, so you can take the manure to the field, so the field will giveyou some grain, so you can take the grain to the miller, so the millerwill give you some bran, so you can take the bran to the sow, so the sowwill give you some bristles, so you can take the bristles to theshoemaker, so the shoemaker will give you some thread, so you can mendyour coat."Then the mouse went to the brook and diverted it onto the meadow, thenthe meadow gave him some grass, then he took the grass to the cow, thenthe cow gave him some manure, then he took the manure to the field, thenthe field gave him some grain, then he took the grain to the miller, thenthe miller gave him some bran, then he took the bran to the sow, then thesow gave him some bristles, then he took the bristles to the shoemaker,then the shoemaker gave him some thread, and then the mouse was able tomend his coat.
