The story literature of India is in a large measure the outcome of themoral revolution of the peninsula connected with the name of GautamaBuddha. As the influence of his life and doctrines grew, a tendencyarose to connect all the popular stories of India round the greatteacher. This could be easily effected owing to the wide spread of thebelief in metempsychosis. All that was told of the sages of the pastcould be interpreted of the Buddha by representing them aspre incarnations of him. Even with Fables, or beast tales, this couldbe done, for the Hindoos were Darwinists long before Darwin, andregarded beasts as cousins of men and stages of development in theprogress of the soul through the ages. Thus, by identifying the Buddhawith the heroes of all folk tales and the chief characters in thebeast drolls, the Buddhists were enabled to incorporate the whole ofthe story store of Hindostan in their sacred books, and enlist ontheir side the tale telling instincts of men.In making Buddha the centre figure of the popular literature of India,his followers also invented the Frame as a method of literary art. Theidea of connecting a number of disconnected stories familiar to usfrom _The Arabian Nights_, Boccaccio's _Decamerone_, Chaucer's_Canterbury Tales_, or even _Pickwick_, is directly traceable to theplan of making Buddha the central figure of India folk literature.Curiously enough, the earliest instance of this in Buddhist literaturewas intended to be a Decameron, ten tales of Buddha's previous births,told of each of the ten Perfections. Asvagosha, the earlier Boccaccio,died when he had completed thirty four of the Birth Tales. But othercollections were made, and at last a corpus of the JATAKAS, orBirth Tales of the Buddha, was carried over to Ceylon, possibly asearly as the first introduction of Buddhism, 241 B.C. There they haveremained till the present day, and have at last been made accessiblein a complete edition in the original Pali by Prof. Fausboll.These JATAKAS, as we now have them, are enshrined in a commentary onthe _gathas_, or moral verses, written in Ceylon by one ofBuddhaghosa's school in the fifth century A.D. They invariably beginwith a "Story of the Present," an incident in Buddha's life whichcalls up to him a "Story of the Past," a folk tale in which he hadplayed a part during one of his former incarnations. Thus the fable ofthe Lion and the Crane, which opens the present collection, isintroduced by a "Story of the Present" in the following words: "A service have we done thee" (the opening words of the _gatha_ ormoral verse). "This the Master told while living at Jetavanaconcerning Devadatta's treachery. Not only now, O Bhickkus, but in aformer existence was Devadatta ungrateful. And having said this hetold a tale." Then follows the tale as given above (pp. 1, 2), and thecommentary concludes: "The Master, having given the lesson, summed upthe Jataka thus: 'At that time, the Lion was Devadatta, and the Cranewas I myself.'" Similarly, with each story of the past the Buddhaidentifies himself, or is mentioned as identical with, the virtuoushero of the folk tale. These Jatakas are 550 in number, and have beenreckoned to include some 2000 tales. Some of these had been translatedby Mr. Rhys Davids (_Buddhist Birth Stories, I._, Trubner's OrientalLibrary, 1880), Prof. Fausboll (_Five Jatakas_, Copenhagen), and Dr.R. Morris (_Folk Lore Journal_, vols. ii. v.). A few exist sculpturedon the earliest Buddhist Stupas. Thus several of the circular figuredesigns on the reliefs from Amaravati, now on the grand staircase ofthe British Museum, represent Jatakas, or previous births of theBuddha.Some of the Jatakas bear a remarkable resemblance to some of the mostfamiliar FABLES OF ESOP. So close is the resemblance, indeed, that it isimpossible not to surmise an historical relation between the two. What thisrelation is I have discussed at considerable length in the "History of theEsopic Fable," which forms the introductory volume to my edition ofCaxton's _Esope_ (London, D. Nutt, "Bibliotheque de Carabas," 1889). Inthis place I can only roughly summarise my results. I conjecture that acollection of fables existed in India before Buddha and independently ofthe Jatakas, and connected with the name of Kasyapa, who was afterwardsmade by the Buddhists into the latest of the twenty seven pre incarnationsof the Buddha. This collection of the Fables of Kasyapa was brought toEurope with a deputation from the Cingalese King Chandra Muka Siwa (obiit52 A.D.) to the Emperor Claudius about 50 A.D., and was done into Greek asthe o i of "Kybises." These were utilised by Babrius (from whomthe Greek Esop is derived) and Avian, and so came into the European Esop.I have discussed all those that are to be found in the Jatakas in the"History" before mentioned, i. pp. 54 72 (see Notes i. xv. xx.). In theseNotes henceforth I refer to this "History" as my _Esop_.There were probably other Buddhist collections of a similar nature tothe Jatakas with a framework. When the Hindu reaction against Buddhismcame, the Brahmins adapted these, with the omission of Buddha as thecentral figure. There is scarcely any doubt that the so called FABLESOF BIDPAI were thus derived from Buddhistic sources. In its Indianform this is now extant as a _Panchatantra_ or Pentateuch, five booksof tales connected by a Frame. This collection is of special interestto us in the present connection, as it has come to Europe in variousforms and shapes. I have edited Sir Thomas North's English version ofan Italian adaptation of a Spanish translation of a Latin version of aHebrew translation of an Arabic adaptation of the Pehlevi version ofthe Indian original (_Fables of Bidpai_, London, D. Nutt,"Bibliotheque de Carabas," 1888). In this I give a genealogical tableof the various versions, from which I calculate that the tales havebeen translated into thirty eight languages in 112 different versions,twenty different ones in English alone. Their influence on Europeanfolk tales has been very great: it is probable that nearly one tenthof these can be traced to the Bidpai literature. (See Notes v. ix. x.xiii. xv.)Other collections of a similar character, arranged in a frame, andderived ultimately from Buddhistic sources, also reached Europe andformed popular reading in the Middle Ages. Among these may bementioned THE TALES OF SINDIBAD, known to Europe as _The Seven Sagesof Rome:_ from this we get the Gellert story (_cf. Celtic FairyTales_), though it also occurs in the Bidpai. Another popularcollection was that associated with the life of St. Buddha, who hasbeen canonised as St. Josaphat: BARLAAM AND JOSAPHAT tells of hisconversion and much else besides, including the tale of the ThreeCaskets, used by Shakespeare in the _Merchant of Venice_.Some of the Indian tales reached Europe at the time of the Crusades,either orally or in collections no longer extant. The earliestselection of these was the _Disciplina Clericalis_ of Petrus Alphonsi,a Spanish Jew converted about 1106: his tales were to be used asseasoning for sermons, and strong seasoning they must have proved.Another Spanish collection of considerably later date was entitled _ElConde Lucanor_ (Eng. trans. by W. York): this contains the fable of_The Man, his Son, and their Ass_, which they ride or carry as thepopular voice decides. But the most famous collection of this kindwas that known as GESTA ROMANORUM, much of which was certainly derivedfrom Oriental and ultimately Indian sources, and so might moreappropriately be termed _Gesta Indorum_.All these collections, which reached Europe in the twelfth andthirteenth centuries, became very popular, and were used by monks andfriars to enliven their sermons as EXEMPLA. Prof. Crane has given afull account of this very curious phenomenon in his erudite edition ofthe _Exempla of Jacques de Vitry_ (Folk Lore Society, 1890). TheIndian stories were also used by the Italian _Novellieri_, much ofBoccaccio and his school being derived from this source. As theseagain gave material for the Elizabethan Drama, chiefly in W. Painter's_Palace of Pleasure_, a collection of translated _Novelle_ which Ihave edited (Lond., 3 vols. 1890), it is not surprising that we can attimes trace portions of Shakespeare back to India. It should also bementioned that one half of La Fontaine's Fables (Bks. vii. xii.) arederived from Indian sources. (_See_ Note on No. v.)In India itself the collection of stories in frames went on and stillgoes on. Besides those already mentioned there are the stories of_Vikram and the Vampire_ (Vetala), translated among others by the lateSir Richard Burton, and the seventy stories of a parrot (_SukaSaptati_). The whole of this literature was summed up by Somadeva, c.1200 A.D. in a huge compilation entitled _Katha Sarit Sagara_ ("Oceanof the Stream of Stories"). Of this work, written in very floridstyle, Mr. Tawney has produced a translation in two volumes in the_Bibliotheca Indica_. Unfortunately, there is a Divorce Courtatmosphere about the whole book, and my selections from it have beenaccordingly restricted. (Notes, No. xi.)So much for a short sketch of Indian folk tales so far as they havebeen reduced to writing in the native literature. The Jatakas areprobably the oldest collection of such tales in literature, and thegreater part of the rest are demonstrably more than a thousand yearsold. It is certain that much (perhaps one fifth) of the popularliterature of modern Europe is derived from those portions of thislarge bulk which came west with the Crusades through the medium ofArabs and Jews. In his elaborate _Einleitung_ to the _Pantschatantra_,the Indian version of the Fables of Bidpai, Prof. Benfey contendedwith enormous erudition that the majority of folk tale incidents wereto be found in the Bidpai literature. His introduction consisted ofover 200 monographs on the spread of Indian tales to Europe. He wrotein 1859, before the great outburst of folk tale collection in Europe,and he had not thus adequate materials to go about in determining theextent of Indian influence on the popular mind of Europe. But he madeit clear that for beast tales and for drolls, the majority of thosecurrent in the mouths of occidental people were derived from Easternand mainly Indian sources. He was not successful, in my opinion, intracing the serious fairy tale to India. Few of the tales in theIndian literary collections could be dignified by the name of fairytales, and it was clear that if these were to be traced to India, anexamination of the contemporary folk tales of the peninsula would haveto be attempted.(Footnote 2: An admirable and full account of this literature wasgiven by M. A. Barth in _Melusine_, t. iv. No. 12, and t. v. No. 1.See also Table i. of Prof. Rhys Davids' _Birth Stories_.)The collection of current Indian folk tales has been the work of thelast quarter of a century, a work, even after what has been achieved,still in its initial stages. The credit of having begun the process isdue to Miss Frere, who, while her father was Governor of the BombayPresidency, took down from the lips of her _ayah_, Anna de Souza, oneof a Lingaet family from Goa who had been Christian for threegenerations, the tales she afterwards published with Mr. Murray in1868, under the title, "_Old Deccan Days, or, Indian Fairy Legendscurrent in Southern India, collected from oral tradition by M. Frere,with an introduction and notes by Sir Bartle Frere_." Her example wasfollowed by Miss Stokes in her _Indian Fairy Tales_ (London, Ellis  White, 1880), who took down her tales from two _ayahs_ and a_Khitmatgar_, all of them Bengalese the _ayahs_ Hindus, and the man aMohammedan. Mr. Ralston introduced the volume with some remarks whichdealt too much with sun myths for present day taste. Anothercollection from Bengal was that of Lal Behari Day, a Hindu gentleman,in his _Folk Tales of Bengal_ (London, Macmillan, 1883). The Panjaband the Kashmir then had their turn: Mrs. Steel collected, and Captain(now Major) Temple edited and annotated, their _Wideawake Stories_(London, Trubner, 1884), stories capitally told and admirablyannotated. Captain Temple increased the value of this collection by aremarkable analysis of all the incidents contained in the two hundredIndian folk tales collected up to this date. It is not too much to saythat this analysis marks an onward step in the scientific study of thefolk tale: there is such a thing, derided as it may be. I havethroughout the Notes been able to draw attention to Indian parallelsby a simple reference to Major Temple's Analysis.Major Temple has not alone himself collected: he has been the causethat many others have collected. In the pages of the _IndianAntiquary_, edited by him, there have appeared from time to timefolk tales collected from all parts of India. Some of these have beenissued separately. Sets of tales from Southern India, collected by thePandit Natesa Sastri, have been issued under the title _Folk Lore ofSouthern India_, three fascicules of which have been recentlyre issued by Mrs. Kingscote under the title, _Tales of the Sun_ (W. H.Allen, 1891): it would have been well if the identity of the two workshad been clearly explained. The largest addition to our knowledge ofthe Indian folk tale that has been made since _Wideawake Stories_ isthat contained in Mr. Knowles' _Folk Tales of Kashmir_ (Trubner'sOriental Library, 1887), sixty three stories, some of great length.These, with Mr. Campbell's _Santal Tales_ (1892). Ramaswami Raju's_Indian Fables_ (London, Sonnenschein, n.d.). M. Thornhill, _IndianFairy Tales_ (London, 1889). and E. J. Robinson, _Tales of S. India_(1885), together with those contained in books of travel likeThornton's _Bannu_ or Smeaton's _Karens of Burmah_ bring up the listof printed Indian folk tales to over 350 a respectable total indeed,but a mere drop in the ocean of the stream of stories that must existin such a huge population as that of India: the Central Provinces inparticular are practically unexplored. There are doubtless manycollections still unpublished. Col. Lewin has large numbers, besidesthe few published in his _Lushai Grammar_. and Mr. M. L. Dames has anumber of Baluchi tales which I have been privileged to use.Altogether, India now ranks among the best represented countries forprinted folk tales, coming only after Russia (1500), Germany (1200),Italy and France (1000 each.) Counting the ancient with the modern,India has probably some 600 to 700 folk tales printed and translatedin accessible form. There should be enough material to determine thevexed question of the relations between the European and the Indiancollections.(Footnote 3: Finland boasts of 12,000, but most of these lie unprintedamong the archives of the Helsingfors Literary Society.)This question has taken a new departure with the researches of M.Emanuel Cosquin in his _Contes populaires de Lorraine_ (Paris, 1886,2e tirage, 1890), undoubtedly the most important contribution to thescientific study of the folk tale since the Grimms. M. Cosquin givesin the annotations to the eighty four tales which he has collected inLorraine a mass of information as to the various forms which the talestake in other countries of Europe and in the East. In my opinion, thework he has done for the European folk tale is even more valuable thanthe conclusions he draws from it as to the relations with India. Hehas taken up the work which Wilhelm Grimm dropped in 1859, and shownfrom the huge accumulations of folk tales that have appeared duringthe last thirty years that there is a common fund of folk tales whichevery country of Europe without exception possesses, though this doesnot of course preclude them from possessing others that are not sharedby the rest. M. Cosquin further contends that the whole of these havecome from the East, ultimately from India, not by literarytransmission, as Benfey contended, but by oral transmission. He hascertainly shown that very many of the most striking incidents commonto European folk tales are also to be found in Eastern _mahrchen_.What, however, he has failed to show is that some of these may nothave been carried out to the Eastern world by Europeans. Borrowingtales is a mutual process, and when Indian meets European, Europeanmeets Indian. which borrowed from which, is a question which we havevery few criteria to decide. It should be added that Mr W. A. Cloustonhas in England collected with exemplary industry a large number ofparallels between Indian and European folk tale incidents in his_Popular Tales and Fictions_ (Edinburgh, 2 vols., 1887) and _Book ofNoodles_ (London, 1888). Mr Clouston has not openly expressed hisconviction that all folk tales are Indian in origin: he prefers toconvince us _non vi sed sepe cadendo_. He has certainly made out agood case for tracing all European drolls, or comic folk tales, fromthe East.With the fairy tale strictly so called _i.e._, the serious folk taleof romantic adventure I am more doubtful. It is mainly a modernproduct in India as in Europe, so far as literary evidence goes. Thevast bulk of the Jatakas does not contain a single example worthy thename, nor does the Bidpai literature. Some of Somadeva's tales,however, approach the nature of fairy tales, but there are severalCeltic tales which can be traced to an earlier date than his (1200A.D.) and are equally near to fairy tales. Yet it is dangerous totrust to mere non appearance in literature as proof of non existenceamong the folk. To take our own tales here in England, there is not asingle instance of a reference to _Jack and the Beanstalk_ for thelast three hundred years, yet it is undoubtedly a true folk tale. Andit is indeed remarkable how many of the _formule_ of fairy tales havebeen found of recent years in India. Thus, the _Magic Fiddle_, foundamong the Santals by Mr. Campbell in two variants (see Notes on vi.),contains the germ idea of the wide spread story represented in GreatBritain by the ballad of _Binnorie_ (see _English Fairy Tales_, No.ix.). Similarly, Mr. Knowles' collection has added considerably to thenumber of Indian variants of European "formule" beyond those noted byIt is still more striking as regards _incidents_. In a paper readbefore the Folk Lore Congress of 1891, and reprinted in the_Transactions_, pp. 76 _seq._, I have drawn up a list of some 630incidents found in common among European folk tales (includingdrolls). Of these, I reckon that about 250 have been already foundamong Indian folk tales, and the number is increased by each newcollection that is made or printed. The moral of this is, that Indiabelongs to a group of peoples who have a common store of stories.India belongs to Europe for purposes of comparative folk tales.Can we go further and say that India is the source of all theincidents that are held in common by European children? I think we mayanswer "Yes" as regards droll incidents, the travels of many of whichwe can trace, and we have the curious result that European childrenowe their earliest laughter to Hindu wags. As regards the seriousincidents further inquiry is needed. Thus, we find the incident of an"external soul" (Life Index, Captain Temple very appropriately namedit) in Asbjornsen's _Norse Tales_ and in Miss Frere's _Old DeccanDays_ (see Notes on _Punchkin_). Yet the latter is a very suspicioussource, since Miss Frere derived her tales from a Christian _ayah_whose family had been in Portuguese Goa for a hundred years. May theynot have got the story of the giant with his soul outside his bodyfrom some European sailor touching at Goa? This is to a certain extentnegatived by the fact of the frequent occurrence of the incident inIndian folk tales (Captain Temple gave a large number of instances in_Wideawake Stories_, pp. 404 5). On the other hand, Mr. Frazer in his_Golden Bough_ has shown the wide spread of the idea among all savageor semi savage tribes. (See Note on No. iv.)In this particular case we may be doubtful. but in others, again asthe incident of the rat's tail up nose (see Notes on _The CharmedRing_) there can be little doubt of the Indian origin. And generally,so far as the incidents are marvellous and of true fairy talecharacter, the presumption is in favour of India, because of thevitality of animism or metempsychosis in India throughout all historictime. No Hindu would doubt the fact of animals speaking or of mentransformed into plants and animals. The European may once have hadthese beliefs, and may still hold them implicitly as "survivals". butin the "survival" stage they cannot afford material for artisticcreation, and the fact that the higher minds of Europe for the lastthousand years have discountenanced these beliefs has not beenentirely without influence. Of one thing there is practical certainty:the fairy tales that are common to the Indo European world wereinvented once for all in a certain locality, and thence spread to allthe countries in culture contact with the original source. The merefact that contiguous countries have more similarities in their storystore than distant ones is sufficient to prove this: indeed, the factthat any single country has spread throughout it a definite set offolk tales as distinctive as its flora and fauna, is sufficient toprove it. It is equally certain that not all folk tales have come fromone source, for each country has tales peculiar to itself. Thequestion is as to the source of the tales that are common to allEuropean children, and increasing evidence seems to show that thiscommon nucleus is derived from India and India alone. The Hindus havebeen more successful than others, because of two facts: they have hadthe appropriate "atmosphere" of metempsychosis, and they have also hadspread among the people sufficient literary training and mental gripto invent plots. The Hindu tales have ousted the native European,which undoubtedly existed independently. indeed, many still survive,especially in Celtic lands. Exactly in the same way, Perrault's taleshave ousted the older English folk tales, and it is with the utmostdifficulty that one can get true English fairy tales because _RedRiding Hood_, _Cinderella_, _Blue Beard_, _Puss in Boots_ and therest, have survived in the struggle for existence among Englishfolk tales. So far as Europe has a common store of fairy tales, itowes this to India.I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not hold with Benfey that allEuropean folk tales are derived from the Bidpai literature and similarliterary products, nor with M. Cosquin that they are all derived fromIndia. The latter scholar has proved that there is a nucleus ofstories in every European land which is common to all. I calculatethat this includes from 30 to 50 per cent. of the whole, and it isthis common stock of Europe that I regard as coming from India mainlyat the time of the Crusades, and chiefly by oral transmission. Itincludes all the beast tales and most of the drolls, but evidence isstill lacking about the more serious fairy tales, though it isincreasing with every fresh collection of folk tales in India, thegreat importance of which is obvious from the above considerations.In the following Notes I give, as on the two previous occasions, the_source_ whence I derived the tale, then _parallels_, and finally_remarks_. For Indian _parallels_ I have been able to refer to MajorTemple's remarkable Analysis of Indian Folk tale incidents at the endof _Wideawake Stories_ (pp. 386 436), for European ones to myalphabetical List of Incidents, with bibliographical references, in_Transactions of Folk Lore Congress_, 1892, pp. 87 98. My _remarks_have been mainly devoted to tracing the relation between the Indianand the European tales, with the object of showing that the latterhave been derived from the former. I have, however, to some extenthandicapped myself, as I have avoided giving again the Indian versionsof stories already given in _English Fairy Tales_ or _Celtic FairyTales_._Source._ V. Fausboll, _Five Jatakas_, Copenhagen, 1861, pp. 35 8,text and translation of the _Javasakuna Jataka_. I have venturedto English Prof. Fausboll's version, which was only intended as a"crib" to the Pali. For the omitted Introduction, see _supra_._Parallels._ I have given a rather full collection of parallels,running to about a hundred numbers, in my _Esop_, pp. 232 4. The chiefof these are: (1) for the East, the Midrashic version ("Lion andEgyptian Partridge"), in the great Rabbinic commentary on Genesis(_Bereshith rabba_, c. 64). (2) in classical antiquity, Phedrus, i. 8("Wolf and Crane"), and Babrius, 94 ("Wolf and Heron"), and the Greekproverb Suidas, ii. 248 ("Out of the Wolf's Mouth"). (3) in the MiddleAges, the so called Greek _Esop_, ed. Halm, 276 _b_, really proseversions of Babrius and "Romulus," or prose of Phedrus, i. 8, also theRomulus of Ademar (fl. 1030), 64. it occurs also on the BayeuxTapestry, in Marie de France, 7, and in Benedict of Oxford's _MishleShualim_ (Heb.), 8. (4) Stainhowel took it from the "Romulus" into hisGerman Esop (1480), whence all the modern European Esops are derived._Remarks._ I have selected _The Wolf and the Crane_ as my typicalexample in my "History of the Esopic Fable," and can only give here arough summary of the results I there arrived at concerning the fable,merely premising that these results are at present no more thanhypotheses. The similarity of the Jataka form with that familiar tous, and derived by us in the last resort from Phedrus, is so strikingthat few will deny some historical relation between them. I conjecturethat the Fable originated in India, and came West by two differentroutes. First, it came by oral tradition to Egypt, as one of theLibyan Fables which the ancients themselves distinguished from theEsopic Fables. It was, however, included by Demetrius Phalereus,tyrant of Athens, and founder of the Alexandrian library c. 300 B.C.,in his _Assemblies of Esopic Fables_, which I have shown to be thesource of Phedrus' Fables c. 30 A.D. Besides this, it came fromCeylon in the Fables of Kybises _i.e._, Kasyapa the Buddha c. 50A.D., was adapted into Hebrew, and used for political purposes, byRabbi Joshua ben Chananyah in a harangue to the Jews c. 120 A.D.,begging them to be patient while within the jaws of Rome. The Hebrewform uses the lion, not the wolf, as the ingrate, which enables usto decide on the Indian _provenance_ of the Midrashic version. It maybe remarked that the use of the lion in this and other Jatakas is indirectly a testimony to their great age, as the lion has becomerarer and rarer in India during historic times, and is now confinedto the Gir forest of Kathiawar, where only a dozen specimens exist,and are strictly preserved.The verses at the end are the earliest parts of the Jataka, being inmore archaic Pali than the rest: the story is told by the commentator(c. 400 A.D.) to illustrate them. It is probable that they werebrought over on the first introduction of Buddhism into Ceylon, c. 241B.C. This would give them an age of over two thousand years, nearlythree hundred years earlier than Phedrus, from whom comes our _Wolfand Crane_._Source._ Miss Stokes, _Indian Fairy Tales_, No. xxii. pp. 153 63,told by Muniya, one of the ayahs. I have left it unaltered, exceptthat I have replaced "God" by "Khuda," the word originally used (seeNotes _l. c._, p. 237)._Parallels._ The tabu, as to a particular direction, occurs in otherIndian stories as well as in European folk tales (see notes on Stokes, p.286). The _grateful animals_ theme occurs in "The Soothsayer's Son"(_infra_, No. x.), and frequently in Indian folk tales (see Temple'sAnalysis, III. i. 5 7. _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 412 3). The thorn in thetiger's foot is especially common (Temple, _l. c._, 6, 9), and recalls thestory of Androclus, which occurs in the derivates of Phedrus, and may thusbe Indian in origin (see Benfey, _Panschatantra_, i. 211, and the parallelsgiven in my _Esop_, Ro. iii. I. p. 243). The theme is, however, equallyfrequent in European folk tales: see my List of Incidents, _Proc. Folk LoreCongress_, p. 91, s.v. "Grateful Animals" and "Gifts by Grateful Animals."Similarly, the "Bride Wager" incident at the end is common to a largenumber of Indian and European folk tales (Temple, Analysis, p. 430. myList, _l. c. sub voce_). The tasks are also equally common (_cf._ "Battleof the Birds" in _Celtic Fairy Tales_), though the exact forms as given in"Princess Labam" are not known in Europe._Remarks._ We have here a concrete instance of the relation of Indianand European fairy tales. The human mind may be the same everywhere,but it is not likely to hit upon the sequence of incidents, _Directiontabu_ _Grateful Animals_ _Bride wager_ _Tasks_, by accident, orindependently: Europe must have borrowed from India, or India fromEurope. As this must have occurred within historic times, indeedwithin the last thousand years, when even European peasants are notlikely to have _invented_, even if they believed, in the incident ofthe grateful animals, the probability is in favour of borrowing fromIndia, possibly through the intermediation of Arabs at the time ofthe Crusades. It is only a probability, but we cannot in any casereach more than probability in this matter, just at present._Source._ Steel Temple, _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 69 72, originallypublished in _Indian Antiquary_, xii. 175. The droll is commonthroughout the Panjab._Parallels._ The similarity of the concluding episode with the finishof the "Three Little Pigs" (_Eng. Fairy Tales_, No. xiv.) In my noteson that droll I have pointed out that the pigs were once goats or kidswith "hair on their chinny chin chin." This brings the tale a stagenearer to the Lambikin._Remarks._ The similarity of Pig No. 3 rolling down hill in the churnand the Lambikin in the Drumikin can scarcely be accidental, though,it must be confessed, the tale has undergone considerable modificationbefore it reached England._Source._ Miss Frere, _Old Deccan Days_, pp. 1 16, from her ayah,Anna de Souza, of a Lingaet family settled and Christianised at Goafor three generations. I should perhaps add that a Prudhan is a PrimeMinister, or Vizier. Punts are the same, and Sirdars, nobles._Parallels._ The son of seven mothers is a characteristic Indianconception, for which see Notes on "The Son of Seven Queens" in thiscollection, No. xvi. The mother transformed, envious stepmother, ringrecognition, are all incidents common to East and West.bibliographical references for parallels may be found under thesetitles in my List of Incidents. The external soul of the ogre has beenstudied by Mr. E. Clodd in _Folk Lore Journal_, vol. ii., "ThePhilosophy of Punchkin," and still more elaborately in the section,"The External Soul in Folk tales," in Mr. Frazer's _Golden Bough_, ii.pp. 296 326. See also Major Temple's Analysis, II. iii., _WideawakeStories_, pp. 404 5, who there gives the Indian parallels._Remarks._ Both Mr. Clodd and Mr. Frazer regard the essence of thetale to consist in the conception of an external soul or "life index,"and they both trace in this a "survival" of savage philosophy, whichthey consider occurs among all men at a certain stage of culture. Butthe most cursory examination of the sets of tales containing theseincidents in Mr. Frazer's analyses shows that many, indeed themajority, of these tales cannot be independent of one another. forthey contain not alone the incident of an external materialised soul,but the further point that this is contained in something else, whichis enclosed in another thing, which is again surrounded by a wrapper.This Chinese ball arrangement is found in the Deccan ("Punchkin"). inBengal (Day, _Folk Tales of Bengal_). in Russia (Ralston, p. 103_seq._, "Koschkei the Deathless," also in Mr. Lang's _Red FairyBook_). in Servia (Mijatovics, _Servian Folk Lore_, p. 172). in SouthSlavonia (Wratislaw, p. 225). in Rome (Miss Busk, p. 164). in Albania(Dozon, p. 132 _seq._). in Transylvania (Haltrich, No. 34). inSchleswig Holstein (Mullenhoff, p. 404). in Norway (Asbjornsen, No.36, _ap._ Dasent, _Pop. Tales_, p. 55, "The Giant who had no Heart inhis Body"). and finally, in the Hebrides (Campbell, _Pop. Tales_, p.10, _cf. Celtic Fairy Tales_, No. xvii., "Sea Maiden"). Here we havethe track of this remarkable idea of an external soul enclosed in asuccession of wrappings, which we can trace from Hindostan to theHebrides.It is difficult to imagine that we have not here the actual migrationof the tale from East to West. In Bengal we have the soul "in anecklace, in a box, in the heart of a _boal_ fish, in a tank". inAlbania "it is in a pigeon, in a hare, in the silver tusk of a wildboar". in Rome it is "in a stone, in the head of a bird, in the headof a leveret, in the middle head of a seven headed hydra". in Russia"it is in an egg, in a duck, in a hare, in a casket, in an oak". inServia it is "in a board, in the heart of a fox, in a mountain". inTransylvania "it is in a light, in an egg, in a duck, in a pond, in amountain". in Norway it is "in an egg, in a duck, in a well, in achurch, on an island, in a lake". in the Hebrides it is "in an egg, inthe belly of a duck, in the belly of a wether, under a flagstone onthe threshold." It is impossible to imagine the human mindindependently imagining such bizarre convolutions. They were borrowedfrom one nation to the other, and till we have reason shown to thecontrary, the original lender was a Hindu. I should add that the mereconception of an external soul occurs in the oldest Egyptian tale of"The Two Brothers," but the wrappings are absent._Source._ _Pantschatantra_, V. ix., tr. Benfey, ii. 345 6._Parallels._ Benfey, in 209 of his _Einleitung_, givesbibliographical references to most of those which are given at lengthin Prof. M. Muller's brilliant essay on "The Migration of Fables"(_Selected Essays_, i. 500 76), which is entirely devoted to thetravels of the fable from India to La Fontaine. See also Mr.Clouston, _Pop. Tales_, ii. 432 _seq._ I have translated the Hebrewversion in my essay, "Jewish Influence on the Diffusion ofFolk Tales," pp. 6 7. Our proverb, "Do not count your chickens beforethey are hatched," is ultimately to be derived from India._Remarks._ The stories of Alnaschar, the Barber's fifth brother inthe _Arabian Nights_, and of La Perette, who counted her chickensbefore they were hatched, in La Fontaine, are demonstrably derivedfrom the same Indian original from which our story was obtained. Thetravels of the "Fables of Bidpai" from India to Europe are well knownand distinctly traceable. I have given a rough summary of the chiefcritical results in the introduction to my edition of the earliestEnglish version of the _Fables of Bidpai_, by Sir Thomas North, ofPlutarch fame (London, D. Nutt, "Bibliotheque de Carabas," 1888),where I have given an elaborate genealogical table of themultitudinous versions. La Fontaine's version, which has rendered thefable so familiar to us all, comes from Bonaventure des Periers,_Contes et Nouvelles_, who got it from the _Dialogus Creaturarum_ ofNicholaus Pergamenus, who derived it from the _Sermones_ of Jacques deVitry (see Prof. Crane's edition, No. li.), who probably derived itfrom the _Directorium Humane Vite_ of John of Capua, a converted Jew,who translated it from the Hebrew version of the Arabic _Kalilah waDimnah_, which was itself derived from the old Syriac version of aPehlevi translation of the original Indian work, probably called afterKarataka and Damanaka, the names of two jackals who figure in theearlier stories of the book. Prof. Rhys Davids informs me that thesenames are more akin to Pali than to Sanskrit, which makes it stillmore probable that the whole literature is ultimately to be derivedfrom a Buddhist source.The theme of La Perette is of interest as showing the _literary_transmission of tales from Orient to Occident. It also shows thepossibility of an influence of literary on oral tradition, as is shownby our proverb, and by the fact, which Benfey mentions, that LaFontaine's story has had influence on two of Grimm's tales, Nos. 164,168._Source._ A. Campbell, _Santal Folk Tales_, 1892, pp. 52 6, with someverbal alterations. A Bonga is the presiding spirit of a certain kindof rice land. Doms and Hadis are low caste aborigines, whose touch isconsidered polluting. The Santals are a forest tribe, who live in theSantal Parganas, 140 miles N.W. of Calcutta (Sir W. W. Hunter, _TheIndian Empire_, 57 60)._Parallels._ Another version occurs in Campbell, p. 106 _seq._, whichshows that the story is popular among the Santals. It is obvious,however, that neither version contains the real finish of the story,which must have contained the denunciation of the magic fiddle of themurderous sisters. This would bring it under the formula of _TheSinging Bone_, which M. Monseur has recently been studying with aremarkable collection of European variants in the Bulletin of theWallon Folk Lore Society of Liege (_cf. Eng. Fairy Tales_, No. ix.).There is a singing bone in Steel Temple's _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 127_seq._ ("Little Anklebone")._Remarks._ Here we have another theme of the common store of Europeanfolk tales found in India. Unfortunately, the form in which it occursis mutilated, and we cannot draw any definite conclusion from it._Source._ The Baka Jataka, Fausboll, No. 38, tr. Rhys Davids, pp.315 21. The Buddha this time is the Genius of the Tree._Parallels._ This Jataka got into the Bidpai literature, andoccurs in all its multitudinous offshoots (_see_ Benfey, _Einleitung_,60) among others in the earliest English translation by North (myedition, pp. 118 22), where the crane becomes "a great Paragone ofIndia (of those that liue a hundredth yeares and neuer mue theirfeathers)." The crab, on hearing the ill news "called to Parliamentall the Fishes of the Lake," and before all are devoured destroys theParagon, as in the Jataka, and returned to the remaining fishes, who"all with one consent gave hir many a thanke."_Remarks._ An interesting point, to which I have drawn attention inmy Introduction to North's Bidpai, is the probability that theillustrations of the tales as well as the tales themselves, weretranslated, so to speak, from one country to another. We can tracethem in Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic MSS., and a few are extant onBuddhist Stupas. Under these circumstances, it may be of interest tocompare with Mr. Batten's conception of the Crane and the Crab(_supra_, p. 50) that of the German artist who illustrated the firstedition of the Latin Bidpai, probably following the traditionalrepresentations of the MS., which itself could probably trace back toIndia._Source._ Miss Stokes, _Indian Fairy Tales_, pp. 73 84. Majnun andLaili are conventional names for lovers, the Romeo and Juliet ofHindostan._Parallels._ Living in animals' bellies occurs elsewhere in MissStokes' book, pp. 66, 124. also in Miss Frere's, 188. The restorationof beauty by fire occurs as a frequent theme (Temple, Analysis, III.vi. f. p. 418). Readers will be reminded of the _denouement_ of Mr.Rider Haggard's _She_. Resuscitation from ashes has been used veryeffectively by Mr. Lang in his delightful _Prince Prigio_._Remarks._ The white skin and blue eyes of Prince Majnun deserveattention. They are possibly a relic of the days of Aryan conquest,when the fair skinned, fair haired Aryan conquered the swarthieraboriginals. The name for caste in Sanskrit is _varna_, "colour". andone Hindu cannot insult another more effectually than by calling him ablack man. _Cf._ Stokes, pp. 238 9, who suggests that the red hair issomething solar, and derived from myths of the solar hero._Source._ Steel Temple, _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 116 20. firstpublished in _Parallels._ No less than 94 parallels are given by Prof. K. Krohn inhis elaborate discussion of this fable in his dissertation, _Mann undFuchs_, (Helsingfors, 1891), pp. 38 60. to which may be added threeIndian variants, omitted by him, but mentioned by Capt. Temple, _l.c._, p. 324, in the _Bhagavata Purana_, the _Gul Bakaoli_ and _Ind.Ant._ xii. 177. and a couple more in my _Esop_, p. 253: add Smeaton,_Karens_, p. 126._Remarks._ Prof. Krohn comes to the conclusion that the majority ofthe oral forms of the tale come from literary versions (p. 47),whereas the _Reynard_ form has only had influence on a single variant.He reduces the century of variants to three type forms. The firstoccurs in two Egyptian versions collected in the present day, as wellas in Petrus Alphonsi in the twelfth century, and the _FabuleExtravagantes_ of the thirteenth or fourteenth: here the ingrateanimal is a crocodile, which asks to be carried away from a riverabout to dry up, and there is only one judge. The second is thatcurrent in India and represented by the story in the presentcollection: here the judges are three. The third is that current amongWestern Europeans, which has spread to S. Africa and N. and S.America: also three judges. Prof. K. Krohn counts the first theoriginal form, owing to the single judge and the naturalness of theopening, by which the critical situation is brought about. The furtherquestion arises, whether this form, though found in Egypt now, isindigenous there, and if so, how it got to the East. Prof. Krohngrants the possibility of the Egyptian form having been invented inIndia and carried to Egypt, and he allows that the European forms havebeen influenced by the Indian. The "Egyptian" form is found in Burmah(Smeaton, _l. c._, p. 128), as well as the Indian, a fact of whichProf. K. Krohn was unaware though it turns his whole argument. Theevidence we have of other folk tales of the beast epic emanating fromIndia improves the chances of this also coming from that source. Onething at least is certain: all these hundred variants come ultimatelyfrom one source. The incident "Inside again" of the _Arabian Nights_(the Djinn and the bottle) and European tales is also a secondaryderivate._Source._ Mrs. Kingscote, _Tales of the Sun_ (p. 11 _seq._), fromPandit Natesa Sastri's _Folk Lore of Southern India_, pt. ii.,originally from _Ind. Antiquary_. I have considerably condensed andmodified the somewhat Babu English of the original._Parallels._ See Benfey, _Pantschatantra_, 71, i. pp. 193 222, whoquotes the _Karma Jataka_ as the ultimate source: it also occurs inthe _Saccankira Jataka_ (Fausboll, No. 73), trans. Rev. R. Morris,_Folk Lore Jour._ iii. 348 _seq._ The story of the ingratitude of mancompared with the gratitude of beasts came early to the West, where itoccurs in the _Gesta Romanorum_, c. 119. It was possibly from an earlyform of this collection that Richard Cur de Lion got the story,and used it to rebuke the ingratitude of the English nobles on hisreturn in 1195. Matthew Paris tells the story, _sub anno_ (it is anaddition of his to Ralph Disset), _Hist. Major_, ed. Luard, ii. 413 6,how a lion and a serpent and a Venetian named Vitalis were saved froma pit by a woodman, Vitalis promising him half his fortune, fiftytalents. The lion brings his benefactor a leveret, the serpent "gemmampretiosam," probably "the precious jewel in his head" to whichShakespeare alludes (_As You Like It_, ii. I., _cf._ Benfey, _l. c._,p. 214, _n._), but Vitalis refuses to have anything to do with him,and altogether repudiates the fifty talents. "Hec referebat RexRichardus munificus, ingratos redarguendo."_Remarks._ Apart from the interest of its wide travels, and itsappearance in the standard medieval History of England by MatthewParis, the modern story shows the remarkable persistence of folk talesin the popular mind. Here we have collected from the Hindu peasant ofto day a tale which was probably told before Buddha, over two thousandyears ago, and certainly included among the Jatakas before theChristian era. The same thing has occurred with _The Tiger, Brahman,and Jackal_ (No. ix. _supra_)._Source._ Somadeva, _Katha Sarit Sagara_, trans. Tawney (Calcutta,1880), i. pp. 272 4. I have slightly toned down the inflated style ofthe original._Parallels _ Benfey has collected and discussed a number in _Orientand Occident_, i. 371 _seq._. see also Tawney, _ad loc_. The mostremarkable of the parallels is that afforded by the Grimms' "DoctorAllwissend" (No. 98), which extends even to such a minute point as hisexclamation, "Ach, ich armer Krebs," whereupon a crab is discoveredunder a dish. The usual form of discovery of the thieves is for theDr. Knowall to have so many days given him to discover the thieves,and at the end of the first day he calls out, "There's one of them,"meaning the days, just as one of the thieves peeps through at him.Hence the title and the plot of C. Lever's _One of Them_._Source._ Knowles, _Folk Tales of Kashmir_, pp. 20 8._Parallels._ The incident of the Aiding Animals is frequent infolk tales: see bibliographical references, _sub voce_, in my List ofIncidents, _Trans. Folk Lore Congress_, p. 88. also Knowles, 21,_n._. and Temple, _Wideawake Stories_, pp. 401, 412. The Magic Ringis also "common form" in folk tales. _cf._ Kohler _ap._ Marie deFrance, _Lais_, ed. Warncke, p. lxxxiv. And the whole story is to befound very widely spread from India (_Wideawake Stories_, pp. 196 206)to England (_Eng. Fairy Tales_, No. xvii, "Jack and his GoldenSnuff box," _cf._ Notes, _ibid._), the most familiar form of it being"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp."_Remarks._ M. Cosquin has pointed out (_Contes de Lorraine_, p. xi._seq._) that the incident of the rat's tail up nose to recover thering from the stomach of an ogress, is found among Arabs, Albanians,Bretons, and Russians. It is impossible to imagine thatincident occurring in the same series of incidents to have beeninvented more than once, and if that part of the story has beenborrowed from India, there is no reason why the whole of it should nothave arisen in India, and have been spread to the West. The Englishvariant was derived from an English Gipsy, and suggests thepossibility that for this particular story the medium of transmissionhas been the Gipsies. This contains the incident of the loss of thering by the faithful animal, which again could not have beenindependently invented.
