An archer, catching a little bird called a nightingale, was aboutto put her to death. But, being gifted with language, she said to him,"What will it advantage you to kill me? I cannot satisfy your appetite.Let me go, and I will give you three rules, from which you will derivegreat benefit, if you follow them accurately."Astonished at hearing the bird speak, he promised her liberty on theconditions she had stated."Hear, then," said she. "Never attempt impossibilities. Secondly, donot lament an irrecoverable loss. Thirdly, do not credit things that areincredible. If you keep these three maxims with wisdom, they willinfinitely profit you."The man, faithful to his promise, let the bird escape. Winging herflight through the air, she commenced a most exquisite song, and, havingfinished, said to the archer, "You are a silly fellow, and have today losta great treasure. There is in my bowels a pearl bigger than the egg of anostrich."Full of vexation at her escape, he immediately spread his nets andendeavored to take her a second time, but she eluded his art."Come into my house, sweet bird," said he, "and I will show you everykindness. I will feed you with my own hands, and permit you to fly abroadat pleasure."The nightingale answered, "Now I am certain you are a fool, and pay noregard to the counsel I gave you: 'Regret not what is irrecoverable.' Youcannot take me again, yet you have spread your snares for that purpose.Moreover, you believe that my bowels contain a pearl larger than the eggof an ostrich, when I myself am nothing near that size! You are a fool,and a fool you will always remain."With this consolatory assurance she flew away. The man returnedsorrowfully to his own house, but never again obtained a sight of thenightingale.Application:My beloved, the archer is any Christian. The nightingale is Christ, andman attempts to kill him as often as he sins.
