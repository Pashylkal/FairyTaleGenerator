from his saddle, mounted his horse, and rode quickly out of the forest.Now, as he was longing to see the princesses, he was very anxious tocome to a river or a fountain, but, though he rode for hours, a river orfountain was nowhere to be seen. Still his heart was light, for he feltthat he had got through the most difficult part of his task, and therest was easy.About mid day he reached a sandy plain, scorching in the sun. Here hewas seized with dreadful thirst. he took his gourd and raised it to hislips.But the gourd was empty. in the excitement of his joy he had forgottento fill it. He rode on, struggling with his sufferings, but at last hecould bear it no longer.He let himself slide to the earth, and lay down beside his horse, histhroat burning, his chest heaving, and his head going round. Already hefelt that death was near him, when his eyes fell on the bag where theoranges peeped out.Poor Desire, who had braved so many dangers to win the lady of hisdreams, would have given at this moment all the princesses in the world,were they pink or golden, for a single drop of water.'Ah!' he said to himself. 'If only these oranges were real fruit fruitas refreshing as what I ate in Flanders! And, after all, who knows?'This idea put some life into him. He had the strength to lift himself upand put his hand into his bag. He drew out an orange and opened it withhis knife.Out of it flew the prettiest little female canary that ever was seen.'Give me something to drink, I am dying of thirst,' said the goldenbird.'Wait a minute,' replied Desire, so much astonished that he forgot hisown sufferings. and to satisfy the bird he took a second orange, andopened it without thinking what he was doing. Out of it flew anothercanary, and she too began to cry:'I am dying of thirst. give me something to drink.'Then Tubby's son saw his folly, and while the two canaries flew awayhe sank on the ground, where, exhausted by his last effort, he layunconscious.
