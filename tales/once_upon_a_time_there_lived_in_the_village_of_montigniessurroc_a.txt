little cow boy, without either father or mother. His real name wasMichael, but he was always called the Star Gazer, because when he drovehis cows over the commons to seek for pasture, he went along with hishead in the air, gaping at nothing.As he had a white skin, blue eyes, and hair that curled all over hishead, the village girls used to cry after him, 'Well, Star Gazer, whatare you doing?' and Michael would answer, 'Oh, nothing,' and go on hisway without even turning to look at them.The fact was he thought them very ugly, with their sun burnt necks,their great red hands, their coarse petticoats and their wooden shoes.He had heard that somewhere in the world there were girls whose neckswere white and whose hands were small, who were always dressed inthe finest silks and laces, and were called princesses, and while hiscompanions round the fire saw nothing in the flames but common everydayfancies, he dreamed that he had the happiness to marry a princess.
