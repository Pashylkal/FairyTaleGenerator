morrow, he will cease to be a Marionette and become a boy. A wonderfulparty of coffee and milk to celebrate the great event.Mindful of what the Fisherman had said, Pinocchio knew that all hopeof being saved had gone. He closed his eyes and waited for the finalmoment.Suddenly, a large Dog, attracted by the odor of the boiling oil, camerunning into the cave."Get out!" cried the Fisherman threateningly and still holding onto theMarionette, who was all covered with flour.But the poor Dog was very hungry, and whining and wagging his tail, hetried to say:"Give me a bite of the fish and I'll go in peace.""Get out, I say!" repeated the Fisherman.And he drew back his foot to give the Dog a kick.Then the Dog, who, being really hungry, would take no refusal, turnedin a rage toward the Fisherman and bared his terrible fangs. And at thatmoment, a pitiful little voice was heard saying: "Save me, Alidoro. ifyou don't, I fry!"The Dog immediately recognized Pinocchio's voice. Great was his surpriseto find that the voice came from the little flour covered bundle thatthe Fisherman held in his hand.Then what did he do? With one great leap, he grasped that bundle in hismouth and, holding it lightly between his teeth, ran through the doorand disappeared like a flash!The Fisherman, angry at seeing his meal snatched from under his nose,ran after the Dog, but a bad fit of coughing made him stop and turnback.Meanwhile, Alidoro, as soon as he had found the road which led to thevillage, stopped and dropped Pinocchio softly to the ground."How much I do thank you!" said the Marionette."It is not necessary," answered the Dog. "You saved me once, and what isgiven is always returned. We are in this world to help one another.""But how did you get in that cave?""I was lying here on the sand more dead than alive, when an appetizingodor of fried fish came to me. That odor tickled my hunger and Ifollowed it. Oh, if I had come a moment later!""Don't speak about it," wailed Pinocchio, still trembling with fright."Don't say a word. If you had come a moment later, I would be fried,eaten, and digested by this time. Brrrrrr! I shiver at the mere thoughtof it."Alidoro laughingly held out his paw to the Marionette, who shook itheartily, feeling that now he and the Dog were good friends. Then theybid each other good by and the Dog went home.Pinocchio, left alone, walked toward a little hut near by, where an oldman sat at the door sunning himself, and asked:"Tell me, good man, have you heard anything of a poor boy with a woundedhead, whose name was Eugene?""The boy was brought to this hut and now ""Now he is dead?" Pinocchio interrupted sorrowfully."No, he is now alive and he has already returned home.""Really? Really?" cried the Marionette, jumping around with joy. "Thenthe wound was not serious?""But it might have been and even mortal," answered the old man, "for aheavy book was thrown at his head.""And who threw it?""A schoolmate of his, a certain Pinocchio.""And who is this Pinocchio?" asked the Marionette, feigning ignorance."They say he is a mischief maker, a tramp, a street urchin ""Calumnies! All calumnies!""Do you know this Pinocchio?""By sight!" answered the Marionette."And what do you think of him?" asked the old man."I think he's a very good boy, fond of study, obedient, kind to hisFather, and to his whole family "As he was telling all these enormous lies about himself, Pinocchiotouched his nose and found it twice as long as it should be. Scared outof his wits, he cried out:"Don't listen to me, good man! All the wonderful things I have said arenot true at all. I know Pinocchio well and he is indeed a very wickedfellow, lazy and disobedient, who instead of going to school, runs awaywith his playmates to have a good time."At this speech, his nose returned to its natural size."Why are you so pale?" the old man asked suddenly."Let me tell you. Without knowing it, I rubbed myself against a newlypainted wall," he lied, ashamed to say that he had been made ready forthe frying pan."What have you done with your coat and your hat and your breeches?""I met thieves and they robbed me. Tell me, my good man, have you not,perhaps, a little suit to give me, so that I may go home?""My boy, as for clothes, I have only a bag in which I keep hops. If youwant it, take it. There it is."Pinocchio did not wait for him to repeat his words. He took the bag,which happened to be empty, and after cutting a big hole at the top andtwo at the sides, he slipped into it as if it were a shirt. Lightly cladas he was, he started out toward the village.Along the way he felt very uneasy. In fact he was so unhappy that hewent along taking two steps forward and one back, and as he went he saidto himself:"How shall I ever face my good little Fairy? What will she say when shesees me? Will she forgive this last trick of mine? I am sure she won't.Oh, no, she won't. And I deserve it, as usual! For I am a rascal, fineon promises which I never keep!"He came to the village late at night. It was so dark he could seenothing and it was raining pitchforks.Pinocchio went straight to the Fairy's house, firmly resolved to knockat the door.When he found himself there, he lost courage and ran back a few steps.A second time he came to the door and again he ran back. A third timehe repeated his performance. The fourth time, before he had time to losehis courage, he grasped the knocker and made a faint sound with it.He waited and waited and waited. Finally, after a full half hour, atop floor window (the house had four stories) opened and Pinocchio sawa large Snail look out. A tiny light glowed on top of her head. "Whoknocks at this late hour?" she called."Is the Fairy home?" asked the Marionette."The Fairy is asleep and does not wish to be disturbed. Who are you?""It is I.""Who's I?""Pinocchio.""Who is Pinocchio?""The Marionette. the one who lives in the Fairy's house.""Oh, I understand," said the Snail. "Wait for me there. I'll come downto open the door for you.""Hurry, I beg of you, for I am dying of cold.""My boy, I am a snail and snails are never in a hurry."An hour passed, two hours. and the door was still closed. Pinocchio, whowas trembling with fear and shivering from the cold rain on his back,knocked a second time, this time louder than before.At that second knock, a window on the third floor opened and the sameSnail looked out."Dear little Snail," cried Pinocchio from the street. "I have beenwaiting two hours for you! And two hours on a dreadful night like thisare as long as two years. Hurry, please!""My boy," answered the Snail in a calm, peaceful voice, "my dear boy, Iam a snail and snails are never in a hurry." And the window closed.A few minutes later midnight struck. then one o'clock two o'clock. Andthe door still remained closed!Then Pinocchio, losing all patience, grabbed the knocker with bothhands, fully determined to awaken the whole house and street with it.As soon as he touched the knocker, however, it became an eel and wiggledaway into the darkness."Really?" cried Pinocchio, blind with rage. "If the knocker is gone, Ican still use my feet."He stepped back and gave the door a most solemn kick. He kicked so hardthat his foot went straight through the door and his leg followed almostto the knee. No matter how he pulled and tugged, he could not pull itout. There he stayed as if nailed to the door.Poor Pinocchio! The rest of the night he had to spend with one footthrough the door and the other one in the air.As dawn was breaking, the door finally opened. That brave little animal,the Snail, had taken exactly nine hours to go from the fourth floor tothe street. How she must have raced!"What are you doing with your foot through the door?" she asked theMarionette, laughing."It was a misfortune. Won't you try, pretty little Snail, to free mefrom this terrible torture?""My boy, we need a carpenter here and I have never been one.""Ask the Fairy to help me!""The Fairy is asleep and does not want to be disturbed.""But what do you want me to do, nailed to the door like this?""Enjoy yourself counting the ants which are passing by.""Bring me something to eat, at least, for I am faint with hunger.""Immediately!"In fact, after three hours and a half, Pinocchio saw her return witha silver tray on her head. On the tray there was bread, roast chicken,fruit."Here is the breakfast the Fairy sends to you," said the Snail.At the sight of all these good things, the Marionette felt much better.What was his disgust, however, when on tasting the food, he found thebread to be made of chalk, the chicken of cardboard, and the brilliantfruit of colored alabaster!He wanted to cry, he wanted to give himself up to despair, he wanted tothrow away the tray and all that was on it. Instead, either from pain orweakness, he fell to the floor in a dead faint.When he regained his senses, he found himself stretched out on a sofaand the Fairy was seated near him."This time also I forgive you," said the Fairy to him. "But be carefulnot to get into mischief again."Pinocchio promised to study and to behave himself. And he kept his wordfor the remainder of the year. At the end of it, he passed first in allhis examinations, and his report was so good that the Fairy said to himhappily:"Tomorrow your wish will come true.""And what is it?""Tomorrow you will cease to be a Marionette and will become a real boy."Pinocchio was beside himself with joy. All his friends and schoolmatesmust be invited to celebrate the great event! The Fairy promised toprepare two hundred cups of coffee and milk and four hundred slices oftoast buttered on both sides.The day promised to be a very gay and happy one, but Unluckily, in a Marionette's life there's always a BUT which is apt tospoil everything.
