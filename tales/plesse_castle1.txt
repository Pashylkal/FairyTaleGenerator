At the time Plesse Castle was to be built people generally believed that acastle could not be conquered if a living child had been entombed in itsfoundation. Therefore a child was to be entombed alive in the foundationof Plesse Castle. It was proclaimed in all municipalities a sum of moneywould be given to anyone who would surrender a child for this purpose. Fora long time no willing person could be found, but finally a woman fromReiershausen sold her deaf and dumb three year old child for 300three pfennig coins. On the day that the child was to be entombed it wassuddenly able to speak, and said, "Mother's breast was softer than apillow, but mother's heart was harder than a stone." And with that thechild was entombed.
