A farmer fell into poverty because he could not keep any cows in hisstalls, the necks of all having been broken one after another. Hetherefore left the farm, which was sold to another. When the newproprietor came into the cowshed one evening and saw that everything wasin a dubious state, he exclaimed, "Good evening, Raginal!"Whereupon a voice answered, "What? Do you know me?""Yes, I have known you for many a year!""If," said the troll, who dwelled beneath, "you will move your cowshed tosome other place, you shall become a wealthy man. I have my habitationunder the cows, and their filth falls down on my table every day, so thatI have been obliged to break their necks."The man removed the cowshed, and thrived from that time.
