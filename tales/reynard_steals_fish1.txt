Reynard saw a man driving a cart full of fish, which made his mouthwater. So he ran and he ran and he ran till he got far away in front ofthe cart and lay down in the road as still as if he were dead.When the man came up to him and saw him lying there dead, as hethought, he said to himself, "Why, that will make a beautiful red foxscarf and muff for my wife Ann."And he got down and seized hold of Reynard and threw him into the cartall along with the fish, and then he went driving on as before. Reynardbegan to throw the fish out till there were none left, and then he jumpedout himself without the man noticing it, who drove up to his door andcalled out, "Ann, Ann, see what I have brought you."And when his wife came to the door she looked into the cart and said,"Why there is nothing there."
