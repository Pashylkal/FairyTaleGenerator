One day the bear was lying eating a horse which he had killed. Reynardwas about again and came slinking along, his mouth watering for a tastybit of the horseflesh. He sneaked in and out and round about till he cameup behind the bear, when he made a spring to the other side of thecarcass, snatching a piece as he jumped across.The bear was not slow either. He made a dash after Reynard and caughtthe tip of his red tail in his paw. Since that time the fox has always hada white tip to his tail."Wait a bit, Reynard, and come here," said the bear, "and I'll teachyou how to catch horses."Yes, Reynard was quite willing to learn that, but he didn't trusthimself too near the bear."When you see a horse lying asleep in a sunny place," said the bear,"you must tie yourself fast with the hair of his tail to your brush, andthen fasten your teeth in his thigh," he said.Before long the fox found a horse lying asleep on a sunny hillside, andso he did as the bear had told him. He knotted and tied himself well tothe horse with the hair of the tail and then fastened his teeth into histhigh.Up jumped the horse and began to kick and gallop, so that Reynard wasdashed against stock and stone, and was so bruised and battered that henearly lost his senses.All at once a hare rushed by. "Where are you off to in such a hurry,Reynard?" asked the hare."I'm having a ride, Bunny!" said the fox.The hare sat up on his hind legs and laughed till the sides of hismouth split right up to his ears, at the thought of Reynard having such agrand ride. but since then the fox has never thought of catching horsesagain.That time it was Bruin who for once had the better of Reynard.Otherwise, they say the bear is as simple minded as the trolls.
