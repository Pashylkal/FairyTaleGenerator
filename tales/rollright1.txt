The "Druidical" Stones at Rollright, Oxfordshire, are said to have beenoriginally a general and his army who were transformed into stones by amagician. The tradition runs that there was a prophecy or oracle whichtold the general, If Long Compton thou canst see,King of England thou shalt be.He was within a few yard of the spot whence that town could be observed,when his progress was stopped by the magician's transformation, Sink down man, and rise up stone!King of England thou shalt be none.The general was transformed into a large stone which stands on a spot fromwhich Long Compton is not visible, but on ascending a slight rise close toit, the town is revealed to view.Roger Gale, writing in 1719, says that whoever dared to contradict thisstory was regarded "as a most audacious freethinker."It is said that no man could ever count these stones, and that a bakeronce attempted it by placing a penny loaf on each of them, but somehow orother he failed in counting his own bread.A similar tale is related of Stonehenge.
