Folk Legends, Customs, and Beliefs from TyrolIn the Sarn Valley there lived a farmer's wife who did not takeChristianity all too seriously. She failed to bless her children morningand night. Nor was she good to people in other regards. She quarreledwith the servants, and no one did well enough to please her.One evening she scolded the entire household and sent the children thebed without giving them a blessing or having them say their prayers.Suddenly the devil stood in the middle of the room, ripped the youngestchild from its bed and was about to carry it away. He was already at thehole in the wall though which he had entered when the farmer's wife sawhim. She was terrified, but fortunately it occurred to her to make thesign of the cross above the child. Seeing this, the devil dropped thechild to the floor and fled screaming back out through the hole.That was a good lesson for the woman. She changed her ways and becamepious and patient, and she also had her children say their prayers.Never again did she allow one of them to get up or go to bed withoutreceiving her blessing. However, no one was ever able to plaster shutthe hole that the devil had made in the wall in order to enter the house.
