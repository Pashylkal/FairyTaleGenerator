Saint Amand sent to the Lord of Avesnes a basket of oranges, with abeautifully written letter saying that these golden fruit, then unknownin Flanders, came straight from a land where the sun always shone.That evening Tubby and his son ate the golden apples at supper, andthought them delicious.Next morning as the day dawned, Desire went down to the stable andsaddled his pretty white horse. Then he went, all dressed for a journey,to the bedside of Tubby, and found him smoking his first pipe.'Father,' he said gravely, 'I have come to bid you farewell. Last nightI dreamed that I was walking in a wood, where the trees were coveredwith golden apples. I gathered one of them, and when I opened it therecame out a lovely princess with a golden skin. That is the wife I want,and I am going to look for her.'The Lord of Avesnes was so much astonished that he let his pipe fall tothe ground. then he became so diverted at the notion of his son marryinga yellow woman, and a woman shut up inside an orange, that he burst intofits of laughter.Desire waited to bid him good bye until he was quiet again. but as hisfather went on laughing and showed no signs of stopping, the young mantook his hand, kissed it tenderly, opened the door, and in the twinklingof an eye was as at the bottom of the staircase. He jumped lightly onhis horse, and was a mile from home before Tubby had ceased laughing.'A yellow wife! He must be mad! fit for a strait waistcoat!' cried thegood man, when he was able to speak. 'Here! quick! bring him back tome.'The servants mounted their horses and rode after the Prince. but asthey did not know which road he had taken, they went all ways exceptthe right one, and instead of bringing him back they returned themselveswhen it grew dark, with their horses worn out and covered with dust.
