Three good comrades, a coal, a bladder, and a straw, had set forthtogether to another land. On their way they came to a horse's hoofprintfilled with water, and they did not know how to get across this ocean.Finally they decided that the straw should lay himself across it, and theothers would walk across the ocean on him.The coal went first. When he got to the middle of the straw, he stoppedto look around, thus burning through the straw, and they both drowned.This seemed very funny to the bladder, and he began to laugh so hardthat he burst.A stone that saw everything said, "Yes, indeed, someone's misfortune,someone's ridicule!"But in the end, those who ridicule also meet with misfortunethemselves.
