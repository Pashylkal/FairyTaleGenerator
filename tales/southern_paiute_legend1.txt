Si chom pa Ka gon (Old Woman of the Sea) came out of the sea with a sackfilled with something, and securely tied. Then she went back to the homeof the Shin au av brothers. She delivered to them the sack and told themto carry it to the middle of the world and open it. There they would meetTov wots, who would tell them what to do with it. Shin au av pa vits (theelder) gave the sack to Shin au av skaits (the younger) and told him to doas Si chom pa Ka gon had directed, and especially enjoined upon him thathe must not open the sack lest some calamity should befall him.As he proceeded, his curiosity overcame him, and he untied the sack, whenout sprang hosts of people who passed out on the plain, shouting andrunning toward the mountain.Then Tov wots suddenly appeared, being very angry. "Why have you donethis? I wanted these people to live in that good land to the east, andhere, foolish boy, you have let them out in a desert."
