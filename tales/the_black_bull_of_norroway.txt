And many a hunting song they sung,And song of game and glee.Then tuned to plaintive strains their tongue,"Of Scotland's luve and lee."To wilder measures next they turn"The Black, Black Bull of Norroway!"Sudden the tapers cease to burn,The minstrels cease to play."The Cout of Keeldar," by J. Leyden.In Norroway, langsyne, there lived a certain lady, and she had threedochters. The auldest o' them said to her mither: "Mither, bake me abannock, and roast me a collop, for I'm gaun awa' to seek my fortune."Her mither did sae. and the dochter gaed awa' to an auld witchwasherwife and telled her purpose. The auld wife bade her stay that day,and gang and look out o' her back door, and see what she could see. Shesaw nocht the first day. The second day she did the same, and saw nocht.On the third day she looked again, and saw a coach and six coming alongthe road. She ran in and telled the auld wife what she saw. "Aweel,"quo' the auld wife, "yon's for you." Sae they took her into the coach,and galloped aff.The second dochter next says to her mither: "Mither, bake me a bannock,and roast me a collop, fur I'm gaun awa' to seek my fortune." Her mitherdid sae. and awa' she gaed to the auld wife, as her sister had dune. Onthe third day she looked out o' the back door, and saw a coach and fourcoming along the road. "Aweel," quo' the auld wife, "yon's for you." Saethey took her in, and aff they set.The third dochter says to her mither: "Mither, bake me a bannock, androast me a collop, for I'm gaun awa' to seek my fortune." Her mither didsae. and awa' she gaed to the auld witch wife. She bade her look outo' her back door, and see what she could see. She did sae. and when shecame back said she saw nocht. The second day she did the same, and sawnocht. The third day she looked again, and on coming back said to theauld wife she saw nocht but a muckle Black Bull coming roaring alang theroad. "Aweel," quo' the auld wife, "yon's for you." On hearing this shewas next to distracted wi' grief and terror. but she was lifted up andset on his back, and awa' they went.Aye they traveled, and on they traveled, till the lady grew faint wi'hunger. "Eat out o' my right lug," says the Black Bull, "and drink outo' my left lug, and set by your leavings." Sae she did as he said, andwas wonderfully refreshed. And lang they gaed, and sair they rade, tillthey came in sight o' a very big and bonny castle. "Yonder we maun bethis night," quo' the bull. "for my auld brither lives yonder". andpresently they were at the place. They lifted her aff his back, and tookher in, and sent him away to a park for the night. In the morning,when they brought the bull hame, they took the lady into a fine shiningparlor, and gave her a beautiful apple, telling her no to break it tillshe was in the greatest strait ever mortal was in in the world, and thatwad bring her o't. Again she was lifted on the bull's back, and aftershe had ridden far, and farer than I can tell, they came in sight o' afar bonnier castle, and far farther awa' than the last. Says the bulltill her: "Yonder we maun be the night, for my second brither livesyonder". and they were at the place directly. They lifted her downand took her in, and sent the bull to the field for the night. In themorning they took the lady into a fine and rich room, and gave her thefinest pear she had ever seen, bidding her no to break it till she wasin the greatest strait ever mortal could be in, and that wad get her outo't. Again she was lifted and set on his back, and awa' they went. Andlang they gaed, and sair they rade, till they came in sight o' the farbiggest castle, and far farthest aff, they had yet seen. "We maun beyonder the night," says the bull, "for my young brither lives yonder".and they were there directly. They lifted her down, took her in, andsent the bull to the field for the night. In the morning they took herinto a room, the finest of a', and gied her a plum, telling her no tobreak it till she was in the greatest strait mortal could be in, andthat wad get her out o't. Presently they brought hame the bull, set thelady on his back, and awa' they went.And aye they gaed, and on they rade, till they came to a dark and ugsomeglen, where they stopped, and the lady lighted down. Says the bull toher: "Here ye maun stay till I gang and fight the deil. Ye maun seatyoursel' on that stane, and move neither hand nor fit till I come back,else I'll never find ye again. And if everything round about ye turnsblue I hae beated the deil. but should a' things turn red he'll haeconquered me." She set hersel' down on the stane, and by and by a' roundher turned blue. O'ercome wi' joy, she lifted the ae fit and crossed itowre the ither, sae glad was she that her companion was victorious. Thebull returned and sought for but never could find her.Lang she sat, and aye she grat, till she wearied. At last she rase andgaed awa', she kedna whaur till. On she wandered till she came to agreat hill o' glass, that she tried a' she could to climb, bat wasnaable. Round the bottom o' the hill she gaed, sabbing and seeking apassage owre, till at last she came to a smith's house. and the smithpromised, if she wad serve him seven years, he wad make her iron shoon,wherewi' she could climb owre the glassy hill. At seven years' end shegot her iron shoon, clamb the glassy hill, and chanced to come to theauld washerwife's habitation. There she was telled of a gallant youngknight that had given in some bluidy sarks to wash, and whaever washedthae sarks was to be his wife. The auld wife had washed till she wastired, and then she set to her dochter, and baith washed, and theywashed, and they better washed, in hopes of getting the young knight.but a' they could do they couldna bring out a stain. At length they setthe stranger damosel to wark. and whenever she began the stains cameout pure and clean, but the auld wife made the knight believe it was herdochter had washed the sarks. So the knight and the eldest dochter wereto be married, and the stranger damosel was distracted at the thoughtof it, for she was deeply in love wi' him. So she bethought her of herapple, and breaking it, found it filled with gold and precious jewelry,the richest she had ever seen. "All these," she said to the eldestdochter, "I will give you, on condition that you put off your marriagefor ae day, and allow me to go into his room alone at night." Sothe lady consented. but meanwhile the auld wife had prepared asleeping drink, and given it to the knight, wha drank it, and neverwakened till next morning. The lee lang night ther damosel sabbed andsang:"Seven lang years I served for thee,The glassy hill I clamb for thee,The bluidy shirt I wrang for thee.And wilt thou no wauken and turn to me?"Next day she kentna what to do for grief. She then brak the pear, andfound it filled wi' jewelry far richer than the contents o' the apple.Wi' thae jewels she bargained for permission to be a second night inthe young knight's chamber. but the auld wife gied him anithersleeping drink, and he again sleepit till morning. A' night she keptsighing and singing as before:"Seven lang years I served for thee,"  c. Still he sleepit, and shenearly lost hope a'thegither. But that day when he was out at thehunting, somebody asked him what noise and moaning was yon they heardall last night in his bedchamber. He said he heardna ony noise. But theyassured him there was sae. and he resolved to keep waking that nightto try what he could hear. That being the third night, and the damoselbeing between hope and despair, she brak her plum, and it held far therichest jewelry of the three. She bargained as before. and the auldwife, as before, took in the sleeping drink to the young knight'schamber. but he telled her he couldna drink it that night withoutsweetening. And when she gaed awa' for some honey to sweeten it wi', hepoured out the drink, and sae made the auld wife think he had drunk it.They a' went to bed again, and the damosel began, as before, singing:"Seven lang years I served for thee,The glassy hill I clamb for thee,The bluidy shirt I wrang for thee.And wilt thou no wauken and turn to me?"He heard, and turned to her. And she telled him a' that had befa'en her,and he telled her a' that had happened to him. And he caused the auldwasherwife and her dochter to be burned. And they were married, and heand she are living happy till this day, for aught I ken.(1)(1) Chambers, Popular Traditions of Scotland.
