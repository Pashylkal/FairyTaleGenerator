A witch, desirous of injuring a neighbor, changed herself into a blackdog and made her way into the neighbor's ben end o' the hoose, where shewould certainly have created serious disturbance if an old man in thefamily had not recognized her by a peculiar formation of the eyelids,which, it seems, she could not discard from her canine appearance.Seizing the tongs, the worthy patriarch brought them down upon theblack dog's back with might and main. "Tak' doo yon, Minnie Merran (thewitch's name), he cried, "an bear doo da weight o' dis auld airm as langas doo leeves."The dog ran howling and limping out of the house, and when next thewitch was seen, she who hitherto had walked upright and with the dignityof a Norna, leant upon a stick, and had a hump upon her back. She said shehad fallen from a height, and was afraid her spine was broken. But folkcalled it "the mark o' auld Jockie's taings."
