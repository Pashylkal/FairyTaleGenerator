I.It was six men of IndostanTo learning much inclined,Who went to see the Elephant(Though all of them were blind),That each by observationMight satisfy his mind.II.The First approached the Elephant,And happening to fallAgainst his broad and sturdy side, At once began to bawl:"God bless me!   but the ElephantIs very like a wall!"III.The Second , feeling of the tusk,Cried: "Ho!   what have we hereSo very round and smooth and sharp?To me 't is mighty clearThis wonder of an ElephantIs very like a spear!"IV.The Third approached the animal,And happening to takeThe squirming trunk within his hands,Thus boldly up and spake:"I see," quoth he, "the ElephantIs very like a snake!"V.The Fourth reached out his eager hand,And felt about the knee."What most this wondrous beast is likeIs mighty plain," quoth he. "'T is clear enough the ElephantIs very like a tree!"VI.The Fifth , who chanced to touch the ear,Said: "E'en the blindest manCan tell what this resembles most.Deny the fact who can,This marvel of an ElephantIs very like a fan!"VII.The Sixth no sooner had begunAbout the beast to grope,Than, seizing on the swinging tailThat fell within his scope,"I see," quoth he, "the ElephantIs very like a rope!"VIII.And so these men of IndostanDisputed loud and long,Each in his own opinionExceeding stiff and strong,Though each was partly in the right,And all were in the wrong.MORAL.So, oft in theologic warsThe disputants, I ween,Rail on in utter ignoranceOf what each other mean,And prate about an ElephantNot one of them has seen!
