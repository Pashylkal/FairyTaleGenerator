Between about 1492 and 1500 in many areas of Germany, for example inBrandenburg and in Mecklenburg, the Jews were committing all kinds ofgodless sins, especially the desecration of the holy sacrament. For thisreason they were expelled from the country by their lords. Duke Bogislavof Pomerania was among those who expelled the Jews, many of whom at thattime were living at Damm near Stettin, at Bart, and in all the small townsin the country.Among these Jews there were a man and a woman who had themselvesbaptized. The Duke allowed them to stay, and they moved to the vicinity ofLake Trieb. However, their baptism was only for the sake of appearance,and in reality they remained Jews. For this reason, they were visiblypunished by God.Every time the woman gave birth to a child, it came to the earth with abloody hand. Because the Christian women observed this, everyone shiedaway from them, and no one wanted to have anything to do with them.Therefore the Jew and his wife moved away from Lake Trieb, first toLassahn, and then to Usedom. But the curse followed them wherever theywent, until they finally underwent a spiritual conversion and confessedthat previously they had remained Jews in their hearts.
