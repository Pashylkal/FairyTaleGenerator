On the banks of the Ganges, which also flows by the most holy city ofBenares, there is a town named Mithila, where dwelt a very poor Brahmancalled Vidyadhara. He had no children, and to compensate for this want, heand his wife tenderly nourished in their house a mongoose   a species ofweasel. It was their all in all   their younger son, their elder daughter  their younger son, their elder daughter   their elder son, theiryounger daughter, so fondly did they regard that little creature.The god Visvesvara and his spouse Visalakshi observed this and had pityfor the unhappy pair. so by their divine power they blessed them with ason. This most welcome addition to their family did not alienate theaffections of the Brahman and his wife from the mongoose. on the contrary,their attachment increased, for they believed that it was because of theirhaving adopted the pet that a son had been born to them. So the child andthe mongoose were brought up together, as twin brothers, in the samecradle.It happened one day when the Brahman had gone out to beg alms of thepious and charitable, that his wife went into the garden to cull somepot herbs, leaving the child asleep in his cradle, and by his side themongoose kept guard. An old serpent, which was living in the well in thegarden, crept into the house and under the cradle, and was beginning toclimb into it to bite the child when the mongoose fiercely attacked it andtore it into several pieces, thus saving the life of the Brahman's littleson, and the venomous snake, that came to slay, itself lay dead beneaththe cradle.Pleased at having performed such an exploit, the mongoose ran into thegarden to show the Brahman's wife its blood smeared mouth, but she rashlymistook the deliverer of her child for his destroyer, and with one strokeof the knife in her hand with which she was cutting herbs she killed thefaithful creature, and then hastened into the house to see her dead son.But there she found the child in his cradle alive and well, only crying atthe absence of his little companion, the mongoose, and under the cradlelay the great serpent cut to pieces.The real state of affairs was now evident, and the Brahman presentlyreturning home, his wife told him of her rash act and then put an end toher life. The Brahman, in his turn, disconsolate at the death of themongoose and his wife, first slew his child and then killed himself.
