There lived in a certain place a Brahman, whose name wasSvabhavak_ri_pa_n_a, which means "a born miser." He had collected aquantity of rice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filleda pot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall,placed his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, hethought, "Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now, if there shouldbe a famine, I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With thisI shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every sixmonths, and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then, with thegoats, I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I shall sell thecalves. Then, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes. with thebuffaloes, mares. When the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty ofhorses. and when I sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shallget a house with four wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house,and will give me his beautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She willhave a son, and I shall call him Somasarman.When he is old enough to be danced on his father's knee, I shall sitwith a book at the back of the stable, and while I am reading, the boywill see me, jump from his mother's lap, and run towards me to bedanced on my knee. He will come too near the horse's hoof, and, fullof anger, I shall call to my wife, 'Take the baby. take him!' But she,distracted by some domestic work, does not hear me. Then I get up, andgive her such a kick with my foot." While he thought this, he gave akick with his foot, and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him, andmade him quite white. Therefore, I say, "He who makes foolish plansfor the future will be white all over, like the father ofSomasarman."
