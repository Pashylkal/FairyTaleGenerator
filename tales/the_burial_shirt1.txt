A mother had a little boy of seven years who was so attractive and goodnatured that no one could look at him without liking him, and he wasdearer to her than anything else in the world. He suddenly died, and themother could find no solace. She cried day and night. However, soon afterhis burial, the child began to appear every night at those places where hehad sat and played while still alive. When the mother cried, he cried aswell, but when morning came he had disappeared.The mother did not cease crying, and one night he appeared with thewhite shirt in which he had been laid into his coffin, and with the littlewreath on his head. He sat down on the bed at her feet and said, "Oh,mother, please stop crying, or I will not be able to fall asleep in mycoffin, because my burial shirt will not dry out from your tears that keepfalling on it." This startled the mother, and she stopped crying.The next night the child came once again. He had a little light in hishand and said, "See, my shirt is almost dry, and I will be able to rest inmy grave." Then the mother surrendered her grief to God and bore it withpatience and peace, and the child did not come again, but slept in hislittle bed beneath the earth.
