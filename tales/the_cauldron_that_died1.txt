One day Johha borrowed a large tanjera , or copper saucepan, froma neighbor for domestic use. Next day he returned it together with a verysmall but quite new one."What is this?" asked the surprised owner."Your tanjera gave birth to a young one during the night,"replied the jester, and, in spite of the incredulity of the other man,maintained his assertion, refusing to take back the smallertanjera , on the ground that the young belonged to the parent andthe parent's owner. Besides, it was cruel to separate so young a childfrom its mother. After a deal of protestation, the neighbor, believing himmad, resolved to humor him, and took the small tanjera , greatlywondering at the jester's whim.Its point was revealed to his chagrin some days later, when Johha cameand borrowed a large and valuable copper dist , or cauldron. This hedid not return, but carried it off to another town, where he sold it.When its owner sent to Johha to reclaim it, the knave said that heregretted his inability to send it back, but the utensil had unfortunatelydied and been devoured by hyenas."What!" exclaimed the owner angrily. "Do you think me fool enough tobelieve that?""Well, my friend," was the reply, "wonderful things sometimes happen.You allowed yourself to be persuaded that your tanjera , forinstance, gave birth to a young one. Why, then, should you not believethat your dist , which is simply a grown up tanjera , shoulddie?"In the circumstances, the argument seemed unanswerable, especiallywhen, after searching through Johha's house, the cauldron could not befound.
