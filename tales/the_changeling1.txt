A couple of Strathspey lads who dealt in whiskey that never paid duty,which they used to purchase in Glenlivat, and sell at Badenoch and FortWilliam, were one night laying in stock at Glenlivat when they heard thechild in the cradle give a piercing cry, just as if it had been shot. Themother, of course, blessed it, and the Strathspey lads took no furthernotice, and soon after set out with their goods.They had not gone far when they found a fine healthy child lying all aloneon the road side, which they soon recognized as that of their friend.They saw at once how the thing was. The fairies had taken away the realchild and left a stock, but, owing to the pious ejaculation of the mother,they had been forced to drop it.As the urgency of their business did not permit them to return, they tookthe child with them, and kept it till the next time they had occasion tovisit Glenlivat. On their arrival they said nothing about the child,which they kept concealed. In the course of conversation, the mother tookoccasion to remark that the disease which had attacked the child the lasttime they were there had never left it, and she had not little hopes ofits recovery. As if to confirm her statement, it continued uttering mostpiteous cries.To end the matter at once, the lads produced the real child healthy andhearty, and told how they had found it. An exchange was at once effected,and they forthwith proceeded to dispose of their new charge. For thispurpose they got an old creel to put him in and some straw to light underit. Seeing the serious turn matters were likely to take, he resolved notto await the trial, but flew up the smoke hole, and when at the top hecried out that things would have gone very differently with them had itnot been for the arrival of their guests.
