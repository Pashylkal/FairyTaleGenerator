In the year 1315 a thief broke into Saint Paul's Church in Magdeburgduring the night and stole a box containing consecrated hosts, which wereused for the sacrament. The next morning he took them to Saint Peter'sChurch, intending to place them on the altar there. However, he changedhis mind and threw the sacrament into a puddle between the paving stonesbehind the churchyard. He turned the box over to the Jews.Now it happened that someone came by with a water cart that was used tocarry water from the River Elbe for the purpose of beer brewing. Thehorses stopped when they came to the place where the sacrament was lying,and they would not proceed. The cart driver became aware of the sacramentlying there, and a miller, who just happened upon the scene, picked it upwith his sword.They soon discovered who the thief was. He was captured in theclothing market with the Jews and was afterward dragged to death.In commemoration of this miracle, the citizens built a chapel where thesacrament had been found. The chapel was named the Chapel of the HolyBody. Inside they painted a mural depicting the event and hung the swordthat had been used to pick up the sacrament.The chapel was still standing behind the Saint Mary Magdalene Conventuntil a short time ago. One could enter the chapel either from theconvent or from the churchyard.Inside the chapel there was also a well and an iron bucket with whichone could draw water.
