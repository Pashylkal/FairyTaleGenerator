A horse who had been used to carry his rider into battle felt himselfgrowing old and chose to work in a mill instead.He now no longer found himself stepping out proudly to the beating of thedrums, but was compelled to slave away allday grinding the corn. Bewailing his hard lot, he said one day to themiller, "Ah me! I was once a splendid war horsegaily caparisoned, and attended by a groom whose sole duty was to see tomy wants. How different is my presentcondition! I wish I had never given up the battlefield for the mill." Themiller replied with asperity, "It's no useyour regretting the past. Fortune has many ups and downs. You must justtake them as they come."
