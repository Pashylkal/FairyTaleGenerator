A young herdsman wanted to get married. Now he knew three sisters. Allwere equally beautiful, and he liked them all equally well, so he couldnot decide which of them he should choose as his bride. His mother noticedthis, and she said to him, "Let me give you some good advice. Invite allthree sisters to eat with you at the same time. Serve them some cheese andpay attention to what they do with it."The son followed this advice. He invited the girls to his house andserved them cheese. The first one greedily ate her piece, complete withthe rind, so that not a trace of it was left. The second one, to thecontrary, cut off the rind so thick that she wasted a lot of good cheese.The third one neatly peeled off just the right amount of rind.The herdsman told his mother what had happened with the cheese, and shesaid, "Choose the third one. She will bring you luck."That is what he did, and as long as he lived, he never regretted havingfollowed his mother's advice.
