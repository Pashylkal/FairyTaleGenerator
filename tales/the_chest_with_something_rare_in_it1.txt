Once upon a time a little boy was walking down a road. After he hadgone a piece he found a chest. "For sure there is something rare in thischest," he said to himself. But however he examined it, he found no way toopen it. "That is very strange," he thought.When he had gone on a piece he found a little key. So he stopped andsat down, and he thought it would be good if the key fit the chest, forthere was a little keyhole in it. So he put the little key into hispocket. First he blew into the key's shaft. Then he blew into the keyhole.Then he put the key into the keyhole and turned it around. "Snap!" wentthe lock. And then he took hold of the lock, and the chest opened.And can you guess what was in the chest?  It was a calf's tail.And if the calf's tail had been longer, this tale would have beenlonger as well.
