Once upon a time a son was born to a certain raja, and the child hadthe ears of an ox. The raja was very much ashamed and let no one know. Butthe secret could not be kept from the barber who had to perform theceremony of shaving the child's head. However, the raja made the barbervow not to tell anyone of what he had seen.So the barber went away, but the secret which he might not tell had anunfortunate effect. It made his stomach swell to an enormous size. As thebarber went along in this unhappy condition he met a Dom (member of a lowcaste, comprising scavangers, basketmakers, and drummers) who asked whyhis stomach was so swollen. The barber said that it was because he hadshaved the raja's child and had seen that it had the ears of an ox.Directly he had broken his vow and blurted out the secret, his stomachreturned to its usual size.The Dom went his way and cut down a tree and made a drum out of thewood, and went about playing on the drum and begging. He came to theraja's palace, and there he drummed and sang:The son of the rajaHas the ears of an ox.When the raja heard this, he was very angry, and swore to punish thebarber who must have broken his vow. But the Dom assured the raja that heknew nothing about the matter, that it was the drum that sang the wordsand not he, and that he had no idea what they meant. So the raja waspacified, and the barber was not punished.
