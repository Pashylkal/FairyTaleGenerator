In the beginning there were no people on the earth.Lumawig, the Great Spirit, came down from the sky and cut many reeds. Hedivided these into pairs which he placed in different parts of the world,and then he said to them, "You must speak."Immediately the reeds became people, and in each place was a man and awoman who could talk, but the language of each couple differed from thatof the others.Then Lumawig commanded each man and woman to marry, which they did. By andby there were many children, all speaking the same language as theirparents. These, in turn, married and had many children. In this way therecame to be many people on the earth.Now Lumawig saw that there were several things which the people on theearth needed to use, so he set to work to supply them. He created salt,and told the inhabitants of one place to boil it down and sell it to theirneighbors. But these people could not understand the directions of theGreat Spirit, and the next time he visited them, they had not touched thesalt.Then he took it away from them and gave it to the people of a place calledMayinit. These did as he directed, and because of this he told them thatthey should always be owners of the salt, and that the other peoples mustbuy of them.Then Lumawig went to the people of Bontoc and told them to get clay andmake pots. They got the clay, but they did not understand the molding, andthe jars were not well shaped. Because of their failure, Lumawig told themthat they would always have to buy their jars, and he removed the potteryto Samoki. When he told the people there what to do, they did just as hesaid, and their jars were well shaped and beautiful. Then the Great Spiritsaw that they were fit owners of the pottery, and he told them that theyshould always make many jars to sell.In this way Lumawig taught the people and brought to them all the thingswhich they now have.
