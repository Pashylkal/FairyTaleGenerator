A Swiss herdsman who often visited his girlfriend had either to makehis way across the Reuss River with great difficulty or to take a longdetour in order to see her.It happened that once he was standing on a very high precipice when hespoke out angrily, "I wish that the devil were here to make me a bridge tothe other side!"In an instant the devil was standing beside him, and said, "If you willpromise me the first living thing that walks across it, I will build abridge for you that you can use from now on to go across and back. Theherdsman agreed, and in a few moments the bridge was finished. However,the herdsman drove a chamois across the bridge ahead of himself, and hefollowed along behind.The deceived devil ripped the animal apart and threw the pieces fromthe precipice.
