There is a curious legend connected with a bridge which spans sometributary of the Rhine forming the boundary between Alsace andSwitzerland. When this bridge was being built, an almost insurmountabledifficulty arose. Beelzebub, always willing to win a human soul, offeredto aid the builders on condition that the first living being that crossedthe bridge should be his, and he sent one of his imps to help.The bridge builder, being aware of the extreme gullibility of the fiend,consented, but outwitted him, for as soon as the bridge was completed, hebrought a black goat, and placing it before him, pushed it across thebridge. Beelzebub's imp, in his rage at being outwitted, grasped the goatby the horns, and hurled it through the floor of the bridge.Every old Alsatian who comes from this part of Alsace will solemnly averthat the hole is still there, because all efforts at repairing the breachare frustrated by Beelzebub's imps.
