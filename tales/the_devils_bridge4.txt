The Devil's Bridge is twelve miles from Aberystwyth.it is over the Afon Mynach just before its junction withthe Rheidol. The Mynach cataract consists of four leaps,making a total descent of 210 feet. The bridge has beenthrown across a chasm 114 feet above the first fall and324 feet above the bottom of the cataract. The originalbridge was constructed by the monks of Strata Florida, atwhat time is unknown, but legend says it was built by thedevil.Old Megan Llandunach, of Pont y Mynach,Had lost her only cow.Across the ravine the cow was seen.But to get it she could not tell how.In this dilemma the Evil One appeared to her cowled asa monk, and with a rosary at his belt, and offered to casta bridge across the chasm if she would promise him thefirst living being that should pass over it when complete.To this she gladly consented. The bridge was thrownacross the ravine, and the Evil One stood beyond bowingand beckoning to the old woman to come over and try it.But she was too clever to do that She had noticed hisleft leg as he was engaged on the construction, and sawthat the knee was behind in place of in front, and for afoot he had a hoof.In her pocket she fumbled, a crust out tumbled,She called her little black cur.The crust over she threw, the dog after it flew,Says she, "The dog's yours, crafty sir!"
