The Devil's Bridge, a remarkable structure, composed of three beautifullyfluted arches, and so named from having, it is said, been built by hisSatanic majesty. if so it is certainly inconsistent and in directcontradiction to his general character, and the good that has come out ofevil in this instance is most remarkable. Respecting the building, thelegend which nearly all Kirkby people will tell you, is as follows:A cow belonging to a poor woman had strayed across the river at someconvenient wading place, and not having returned with the town herd atmilking time, the woman went forth to seek her. In the meantime the waterhad risen considerably, and, not being able to cross the river, the womanwas in a dilemma, for her good man, a laborer, and her cow, were on theopposite side. At this juncture the devil, in human form, appeared on theother bank, no doubt assuming the soft guile of the tempter, promised tobuild a bridge, on condition that the first living thing which passed overshould become his lawful prize. to this the woman gladly assented.Darkness deepened rapidly   necessary for diabolical thought and deed,which in this instance was frustrated by the forethought of the woman,whose husband or herself had been singled out for the victim which was topropitiate the building of the bridge. At the appointed hour she returned,bringing with her a dog, and a delicious morsel wherewith to tempt it. Thebridge was complete, and there stood his sable majesty, anxiously awaitinghis victim.Suddenly, across the bridge, she threw the tempting morsel, and after itsprang the dog. The devil, seeing how cleverly he had been outwitted, gaveforth a terrific howl, which aroused all the inhabitants in the old town,who at once rushed down to the river to ascertain the cause, thinkingthere had been an earthquake, instead of which they were agreeablyastonished to find a substantial bridge, across which the woman,accompanied by her husband and dog, were driving the cow.And there still stands the remarkable structure to witness or attest thetruth, as story says, if I lie, and as a further proof, below the bridgeis still to be seen the Devil's Neck Collar   a rock with a largeperforation, which he lost from his neck in that wild unearthly plungefrom the bridge, on finding his hellish scheme thwarted.
