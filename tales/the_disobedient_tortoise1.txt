In a certain pond there once lived a tortoise by the name ofKamburgriva (Shell Neck). He had two friends who belonged to the goosefamily and who had grown very fond of him. One was named Sankata (Small)and the other Vikata (Large). They regularly came to the pond's bank wherethey told one another many stories about the wise ones among the gods,Brahmans, and kings. At sunset they would return to their nests.However, in the course of time the pond began to dry up, due to thelack of rain. Pained by this misfortune, the two said, "Alas, friend, thispond has become nothing but mud. How will you stay alive? Our hearts aresaddened."Hearing this, Kamburgriva said, "I cannot live without water. Let usthink of a solution! For it is said, 'The wise always rush to aid theirrelatives and friends in time of need.' Therefore fetch a strong stick andseek a pond that still contains much water. I shall grasp the stick whichyou will carry in your teeth from both ends and thus take me to thepond.""Friend, that we will do!" the two replied, "but you must remain asspeechless as a saint who has taken an oath of silence, lest you fall fromthe stick and break into pieces."The tortoise said, "For certain. I promise to say nothing from nowuntil we have landed at the pond."They proceeded as planned, and from his flight Kamburgriva looked downupon the city beneath him, whose startled inhabitants were shouting,"Look! Look! Two birds are carrying something like a carriage!"Hearing their cries, Kamburgriva began to speak. He wanted to say,"What are you shouting about?" but before he had half uttered the words,he fell earthward and was torn into pieces by the city's inhabitants.
