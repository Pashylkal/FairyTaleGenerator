In the beginning there was no enmity between the cat and dog, and theylived on friendly terms together and served their master (Adam)faithfully, each one doing its own work.But as you know, it is very much better to have a written agreement at thebeginning than to have a row afterwards, so they decided to draw up anagreement defining the work which each had to do, and decided that the dogwas to do the work outside the house, and the cat the work inside. Forgreater safety the dog agreed that the cat should take care of theagreement, and the cat put it in the loft.After a time, the devil, who could not allow peace to last for a longtime, must needs set the dog up against the cat. so one day the dogremarked to the cat that he was not fairly treated. He did not see why heshould have all the trouble outside the house, to watch for thieves andprotect the house and suffer from cold and rain, and only have scraps andbones for food, and sometimes nothing at all, whilst the cat had all thecomfort, purring and enjoying herself, and living near the hearth inwarmth and safety.The cat said, "An agreement is an agreement."The dog replied, "Let me see that agreement."The cat went quickly up the loft to fetch the agreement, but theagreement, which had been a little greasy, had been nibbled by the micewho were living in the loft, and they went on nibbling away until nothingwas left of it but a heap of paper fluff, and as it was as soft as downthe mice made their home of it.When the cat came up and saw what the mice had done, her fury knew nobounds. She pursued them madly, killing as many as she could seize, andrunning after the others with the intent of catching them.When she came down the dog asked her for the agreement, and as the cat hadnot brought it, the dog, taking hold of her, shook her until he got tiredof shaking her.Since that time, whenever a dog meets a cat he asks her for the agreement,and as she cannot show it to him he goes for her. And the cat, knowingwhat the mice had done to her, runs after them when she sees them.
