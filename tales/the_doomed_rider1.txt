The Conan is as bonny a river as we hae in a' the north country. There 'smony a sweet sunny spot on its banks, an' mony a time an' aft hae I wadedthrough its shallows, whan a boy, to set my little scautling line for thetrouts an' the eels, or to gather the big pearl mussels that lie sae thickin the fords. But its bonny wooded banks are places for enjoying the dayin   no for passing the nicht. I kenna how it is. it 's nane o' your wildstreams that wander desolate through a desert country, like the Aven, orthat come rushing down in foam and thunder, ower broken rocks, like theFoyers, or that wallow in darkness, deep, deep in the bowels o' the earth,like the fearfu' Auldgraunt. an' yet no ane o' these rivers has mair orfrightfuller stories connected wi' it than the Conan. Ane can hardlysaunter ower half a mile in its course, frae where it leaves Coutin tillwhere it enters the sea, without passing ower the scene o' some frightfulauld legend o' the kelpie or the waterwraith.And ane o' the most frightful looking o' these places is to be found amongthe woods of Conan House. Ye enter a swampy meadow that waves wi' flagsan' rushes like a corn field in harvest, an' see a hillock covered wi'willows rising like an island in the midst. There are thick mirk woods onilka side. the river, dark an' awesome, an' whirling round an' round inmossy eddies, sweeps away behind it. an' there is an auld burying ground,wi' the broken ruins o' an auld Papist kirk, on the tap. Ane can see amangthe rougher stanes the rose wrought mullions of an arched window, an' thetrough that ance held the holy water. About twa hunder years ago   a weemair maybe, or a wee less, for ane canna be very sure o' the date o' thaeold stories   the building was entire. an' a spot near it, whar the woodnow grows thickest, was laid out in a corn field. The marks o' the furrowsmay still be seen amang the trees.A party o' Highlanders were busily engaged, ae day in harvest, in cuttingdown the corn o' that field. an' just aboot noon, when the sun shonebrightest an' they were busiest in the work, they heard a voice frae theriver exclaim, "The hour but not the man has come."Sure enough, on looking round, there was the kelpie stan'in' in what theyca' a fause ford, just foment the auld kirk. There is a deep black poolbaith aboon an' below, but i' the ford there 's a bonny ripple, thatshows, as ane might think, but little depth o' water. an' just i' themiddle o' that, in a place where a horse might swim, stood the kelpie. An'it again repeated its words, "The hour but not the man has come," an' thenflashing through the water like a drake, it disappeared in the lower pool.When the folk stood wondering what the creature might mean, they saw a manon horseback come spurring down the hill in hot haste, making straight forthe fause ford. They could then understand her words at ance. an' four o'the stoutest o' them sprang oot frae amang the corn to warn him o' hisdanger, an' keep him back. An' sae they tauld him what they had seen an'heard, an' urged him either to turn back an' tak' anither road, or stayfor an hour or sae where he was. But he just wadna hear them, for he wasbaith unbelieving an' in haste, an' wauld hae taen the ford for a' theycould say, hadna the Highlanders, determined on saving him whether hewould or no, gathered round him an' pulled him frae his horse, an' then,to mak' sure o' him, locked him up in the auld kirk.Weel, when the hour had gone by   the fatal hour o' the kelpie   theyflung open the door, an' cried to him that he might noo gang on hisjourney. Ah ! but there was nae answer, though. an' sae they cried asecond time, an' there was nae answer still. an' then they went in, an'found him lying stiff an' cauld on the floor, wi' his face buried in thewater o' the very stone trough that we may still see amang the ruins. Hishour had come, an' he had fallen in a fit, as 'twould seem, head foremostamang the water o' the trough, where he had been smothered,   an' sae yesee, the prophecy o' the kelpie availed naething.
