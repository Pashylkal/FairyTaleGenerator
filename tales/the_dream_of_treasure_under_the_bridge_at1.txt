LimerickI heard of a man from Mayo went to Limerick, and walked two or three timesacross the bridge there. And a cobbler that was sitting on the bridge tooknotice of him, and knew by the look of him and by the clothes he wore thathe was from Mayo, and asked him what was he looking for. And he said hehad a dream that under the bridge of Limerick he'd find treasure."Well," says the cobbler, "I had a dream myself about finding treasure,but in another sort of a place than this." And he described the placewhere he dreamed it was, and where was that, but in the Mayo man's owngarden.So he went home again, and sure enough, there he found a pot of gold withno end of riches in it. But I never heard that the cobbler found anythingunder the bridge at Limerick.
