Children's and Household TalesA mother had her child taken from the cradle by elves. In its place theylaid a changeling with a thick head and staring eyes who would do nothingbut eat and drink. In distress she went to a neighbor and asked foradvice. The neighbor told her to carry the changeling into the kitchen,set it on the hearth, make a fire, and boil water in two eggshells. Thatshould make the changeling laugh, and if he laughs it will be all overwith him. The woman did everything just as her neighbor said. When sheplaced the eggshells filled with water over the fire, the blockhead said:Now I am as oldAs the Wester Wood,But have never seen anyone cooking in shells!And he began laughing about it. When he laughed, a band of little elvessuddenly appeared. They brought the rightful child, set it on thehearth, and took the changeling away.
