Once upon a time there was a certain man, who, being overtaken by darknessamong the mountains, was driven to seek shelter in the trunk of a hollowtree. In the middle of the night, a large company of elves assembled atthe place. and the man, peeping out from his hiding place, was frightenedout of his wits. After a while, however, the elves began to feast anddrink wine, and to amuse themselves by singing and dancing, until at lastthe man, caught by the infection of the fun, forgot all about his fright,and crept out of his hollow tree to join in the revels.When the day was about to dawn, the elves said to the man, "You're a veryjolly companion, and must come out and have a dance with us again. Youmust make us a promise, and keep it."So the elves, thinking to bind the man over to return, took a large wenthat grew on his forehead and kept it in pawn. upon this they all left theplace, and went home.The man walked off to his own house in high glee at having passed a jovialnight, and got rid of his wen into the bargain. So he told the story toall his friends, who congratulated him warmly on being cured of his wen.But there was a neighbor of his who was also troubled with a wen of longstanding, and, when he heard of his friend's luck, he was smitten withenvy, and went off to hunt for the hollow tree, in which, when he hadfound it, he passed the night.Elves, mistaking him for their former boon companion, were delighted tosee him, and said, "You're a good fellow to recollect your promise, andwe'll give you back your pledge."So one of the elves, pulling the pawned wen out of his pocket, stuck itonto the man's forehead, on the top of the other wen which he already had.So the envious neighbor went home weeping, with two wens instead of one.This is a good lesson to people who cannot see the good luck of others,without coveting it for themselves.
