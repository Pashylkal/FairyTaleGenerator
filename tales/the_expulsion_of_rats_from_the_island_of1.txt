UmmanzMany years ago there were so many rats on the Island of Ummanz that theinhabitants could not find refuge from the vermin. Then a sorcerer fromabroad presented himself, offering   for a large sum of money   to driveall the rats from the island. The people of Ummanz agreed to pay thisvery high price, even though he stated from the beginning that he would beable to ban the rats only for the lifetime of the population thatcurrently lived there. Then the sorcerer drove all the rats to thesouthwestern point of Ummanz and into the water. This region is thuscalled the Rott even today.They say that the soil from this area formerly could be used asprotection against rats. People who were plagued with rats would go toUmmanz and get a sack of soil from the Rott . A small handful ofthis soil shook into the rat holes would be sufficient to drive the ratsaway within a few hours. All this was credited to the foreignsorcerer.More recently, however, following the death of the earlier populationand after many outsiders had come to Ummanz, rats found their way back tothe island, and since then not even soil from the Rott will help todrive them away.
