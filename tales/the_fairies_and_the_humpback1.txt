A man who was a hump back once met the fairies dancing, and danced withtheirqueen. and he sang with them, "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday," so well thattheytook off his hump, and he returned home a straight bodied man.Then a tailor went past the same place, and was also admitted by thefairies totheir dance. He caught the fairy queen by the waist, and she resented hisfamiliarity. And in singing he added "Thursday" to their song and spoiltit.To pay the tailor for his rudeness and ill manners, the dancers took upthe humpthey had just removed from the first man and clapped it on his back, andtheconceited fellow went home a hump back.
