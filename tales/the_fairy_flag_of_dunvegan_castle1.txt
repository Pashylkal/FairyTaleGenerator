Among the treasures of Dunvegan is a green fairy flag, which somematerialists believe to be only a relic of the Crusades   a consecratedbanner of the Knights Templars, but which all true Highlanders affirm tohave been a gift to some ancestral MacLeod, from a fairy maiden. Shepromised that on three distinct occasions when he or his clan were indanger, he might wave the flag with certainty of relief.MacLeod proved false to his fairy, and married a mere commonplace humanmaiden, whereupon his spirit wife waxed wroth, and ordained that everywoman in the clan should give birth to a dead child, and that all thecattle should have dead calves. Then a loud and bitter wail rang throughthe green valleys, and along the shores, and MacLeod, in sore tribulation,bethought him of the flag. The fairy proved more true to her words thanher lover had been to his, so she withdrew her spell, and the clan oncemore flourished.Then came a terrible battle, when MacLeod and his men were well nighrouted, and again, though he must have been sorely ashamed of himself, hewaved the flag, and the victory was his. Why the flag was not waved forthe third time, when the isles were ruined by the failure of the kelptrade, or during the potato famine, MacLeod best knows. Perhaps he thoughtit well to save one "last tune in the old fiddle." At all events the greenflag still lies in its old case, and is such a treasure as no other lairdcan show.
