There lived a woman in Innish Shark   one of the group of islands onthe eastern coast   named Biddy Mannion, as handsome and likely afisherman's wife as you would meet in a day's walk. She was tall, and fairin the face, with skin like an egg, and hair that might vie with the glossof the raven's wing.She was married about a twelvemonth, when the midwife presented herhusband, Patsy Andrew M'Intire, with as fine a man child as could be foundbetween Shark and America, and sure they are the next parishes, with onlythe Atlantic for a mearing between them. The young one throve apace, andall the women and gossips said the Biddy Mannion was the lucky woman, andthe finest nurse seen in the island for many a day.Now the king of the fairies had a child about the same age, or a littleolder. But the queen was not able to nurse it, for she was might weaklyafter her lying in, as her husband had a falling out with another fairypotentate that lives down one side of the Giant's Causeway, who, by theforce of magic and pishrogues , banished the suck from the Connaughtprincess for spite.The gentry had their eye upon Biddy Mannion for a long time, but as shealways wore a gospel round her neck, and kept an errub and abit of a burnt sod from St. John's Night sewed up in her clothes, she wasproof against all their machinations and seductions. At long run, however,she lost this herb, and one fine summer's night the young gaurlaugh(infant), being mighty cross with the teeth, wouldn't sleep in the cradleat all, but was evermore starting and crying, as if the life was leavinghim, so she got up at last, determined to take him to bed to herself, andshe went down to the kitchen to light a candle.Well, just as she was blowing a coal, three men caught a hold of herbefore she could bless herself, and she was unable to shout or say a word,so they brought her out of the house quite easy, and put her upon apillion, behind one of themselves, on a fine black horse that was readywaiting outside the door. She was no sooner seated behind one of the menthan away they all galloped, without saying a word. It was as calm andbeautiful a night as ever came out of the sky, just before the moon rose"between day and dark," with the gloom of parting twilight softening everybreak upon the surrounding landscape, and not a breath of air was to befelt.They rode on a long time, and she didn't know where they were going to.but she thought to herself they must be on the mainland, for she heard thefrogs croaking in ditches. (There are no frogs in these small islands.)The bunnaun lena (bittern) was sounding away in the bogs, and theminnaun airigh (clocking snipe) was wheeling over their heads.(Neither of these birds are found in the small islands of the west.)At last the horse stopped of itself all of a sudden before the gate ofa big house at the butt of a great hill, with trees growing all round it,where she had never been before in her life. There was much light in thehouse, and presently a grand looking gentleman dressed all in scarlet,with a cocked hat on his head and a sword by his side, and his fingers socovered with rings that they shone like lassar lena ( ranunculusflammea , a brilliant yellow flower) in a bog hole, lifted her off thepillion as polite as possible, handed her into the house, and bid her acead mile failte , just the same as if he had known her all hislifetime.The gentleman left her sitting in one of the rooms, and when hewas gone she saw a young woman standing at the thrashal of thedoor, and looking very earnestly at her, as if she wanted to speak toher."Troth, I'll speak, anyway," says Biddy Mannion, "for if I didn't, I'msure I'd burst." And with that she bid her the time of day, and asked herwhy she was looking at her so continuously.The woman then gave a great sigh, and whispered to her, "If you take myadvice, Biddy Mannion, you'll not taste bit, bite, or sup, while you arein this house, for if you do you'll be sorry for it, and maybe never gethome again to your child or husband. I ate and drank my fill, forriorgeraugh (an expression denoting great regret), the first night I came,and that's the reason that I am left here now in this enchanted place,where everything you meet is bewitched, even to the meat itself. But whenyou go home, send word to them that's after me, Tim Conneely, that livesone side of the Killaries, that I am here, and may be he'd try what FatherPat Prendergast, the blessed abbot of Cong, could do to get me out ofit."Biddy was just going to make further inquiries, when in the clapping ofyour hand the woman was gone, and the man with the scarlet coat came back,and the same strange woman, bringing a young child in her arms. The mantook the child from the woman, and gave it to Biddy to put it to thebreast, and when it had drank its fill he took it away, and invited herinto another room, where the queen   a darling, fine looking lady asyou'd meet in a day's walk   was seated in an armchair, surrounded by apower of quality, dressed up for all the world like judges with big wigs,and red gowns upon them. There was a table laid out with all sorts ofeating, which the man in the cocked hat pressed her to take. She madeanswer that she was no ways hungry, but that if they could give her a curefor a little girl belonging to one of her neighbors, who was mightydauny , and never well in herself since she had a fit of thefeur gurtagh (literally, "hungry grass," a weakness, the result ofsudden hunger, said to come on persons in consequence of treading on aparticular kind of fairy enchanted grass), while crossing the Minaune Passin Achill, and to send herself home to Shark, she would be forever obligedto them.The king, for that was the gentleman with the cocked hat, said he hadne'er a cure."Indeed, then," said the mother of the child, "as I was the cause ofyour coming here, honest woman, you must get the cure. go home," says she,speaking for all the world like an Englishwoman, "and get ten green rishesfrom the side of the well of Aughavalla (a holy well in the barony ofMurrisk, not far from Croagh Patrick). Throw the tenth away, and squeezethe juice of the rest of them into the bottom of a teacup, and give it tothe colleen to drink, and she will get well in no time."The king then put a ring on her finger and told her not to lose it byany manner of means, and that as long as she wore this ring no personcould hurt or harm her. He then rubbed a sort of an ointment on her eyes,and no sooner had he done so that she found herself in a frightful cavewhere she couldn't see her hand before her."Don't be any ways afraid," says he. "This is to let you know what kindof a people we are that took you away. We are the fallen angels that thepeople up above upon the earth call the fairies."And then after a while she began to see about her, and the place wasfull of dead men's bones, and had a terribly musty smell. And after awhile he took her into another room where there was more light, and hereshe found a wonderful sight of young children, and them all blindfolded,and doing nothing but sitting upon pookauns (mushrooms,fairy stools, or puff balls) These were the souls of infants that werenever baptized, and are believed "to go into naught." After that he showedher a beautiful garden, and at the end of it there was a large gate, whichhe opened with a key that was hung to his watch chain."Now," says he, "you are not far from you own house," so he let herout. and then says he, "Who is that that is coming down the boreen?" Andwhen she turned her back to look who it was, behold the man with the redcoat and the cocked hat had disappeared.Biddy Mannion could not see anybody, but she knew full well the placewhere she was in a minute, and that it was the little road the led down tothe annagh (a cut away bog) just beside her own house, and when shewent up to the door she met another woman the very moral ofherself, just as fair as if she saw her in the looking glass, who said toher as she passed, "What a gomal your husband is that didn't knowthe difference between you and me."She said no more, but Biddy went in and found her child in a beautifulsleep, with his face smiling, like the buttercups in May.
