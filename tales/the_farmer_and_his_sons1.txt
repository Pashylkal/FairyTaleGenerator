A certain farmer, lying at the point of death, called his sons around him,and gave into their charge his fields andvineyards, telling them that a treasure lay hidden somewhere in them,within a foot of the surface of the ground. Hissons thought he spoke of money which he had hidden, and after he wasburied, they dug most industriously all over theestate, but found nothing. The soil being so well loosened, however, thesucceeding crops were of unequalled richness,and the sons then found out what their father had in view in telling themto dig for hidden treasure.Moral: Industry is fortune's right hand.
