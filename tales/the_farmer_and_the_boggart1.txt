T' boggart, a squat hairy man, strong as a six year old horse, and witharms almost as long as tackle poles, comes to a farmer who has just takena bit of land, and declares that he is the proper owner, and the farmermust quit. The farmer proposes an appeal to the law, but boggart will havenaught to do wi' law, which has never yet done him justice, and suggeststhat they should share the produce equally."Very well," says the farmer, "wilt thou tek what grows above ground, orwhat grows beneath ground? Only, moind, thou mun stick to what thousattles. oi doant want no back reckunnings after."He arranges to take what grows above ground, and the farmer promptly setspotatoes. Of course, when the boggart comes at harvest time to claim hisshare he gets nothing but the haulms and twitch, and is in a sore taking.At last, however, he agrees to take all that grows beneath ground for nextseason, whereupon the farmer sows wheat, and when boggart comes round att' backend, the man gets corn and straw, and naught is left for boggartbut the stubble.Boggart then insists that next year wheat should be sown again, and thatthey should mow together, each taking what he mows. The farmer consultsthe local wise man, and studs boggart's "falls" with thin iron rods, whichwear down boggart's strength in cutting and take all the edge of hisscythe. So boggart stops to whet, and boggart stops to rest, but thefarmer mows steadily on till at last the boggart throws down his scythe indespair and says, "Ye may tek t' mucky owd land an' all 'ats on it. Iwean't hev no more to do wi' it."And off he goes and nivver comes back no more, leastways not after noland, but awms aboot t' delves, an' skears loane foaks o' noights. an' ifthou leaves thy dinner or thy tools about, ofttimes he meks off wi' 'em.
