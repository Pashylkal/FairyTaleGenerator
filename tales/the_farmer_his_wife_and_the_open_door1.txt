Once upon a time a poor farmer and his wife, having finished theirday's labor and eaten their frugal supper, were sitting by the fire, whena dispute arose between them as to who should shut the door, which hadbeen blown open by a gust of wind."Wife, shut the door!" said the man."Husband, shut it yourself!" said the woman."I will not shut it, and you shall not shut it," said the husband. "butlet the one who speaks the first word shut it."This proposal pleased the wife exceedingly, and so the old couple, wellsatisfied, retired in silence to bed.In the middle of the night they heard a noise, and, peering out, theyperceived that a wild dog had entered the room, and that he was busydevouring their little store of food. Not a word, however, would either ofthese silly people utter, and the dog, having sniffed at everything, andhaving eaten as much as he wanted, went out of the house.The next morning the woman took some grain to the house of a neighborin order to have it ground into flour.In her absence the barber entered, and said to the husband, "How is ityou are sitting here all alone?"The farmer answered never a word. The barber then shaved his head, butstill he did not speak. then he shaved off half his beard and half hismustache, but even then the man refrained from uttering a syllable. Thenthe barber covered him all over with a hideous coating of lampblack, butthe stolid farmer remained as dumb as a mute. "The man is bewitched!"cried the barber, and he hastily quitted the house.He had hardly gone when the wife returned from the mill. She, seeingher husband in such a ghastly plight, began to tremble, and exclaimed,"Ah! wretch, what have you been doing?""You spoke the first word," said the farmer, "so begone, woman, andshut the door."
