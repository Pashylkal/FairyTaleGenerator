A young man of Matsue was returning home from a wedding party when hesaw, just in front of his house, a firefly. He paused a moment, surprisedto see such an insect on a cold winter's night with snow on the ground.While he stood and meditated, the firefly flew toward him, and the youngman struck at it with his stick, but the insect flew away and entered thegarden adjoining his own.The next day he called at his neighbor's house, and was about to relatethe experience of the previous night when the eldest daughter of thefamily entered the room, and exclaimed, "I had no idea you were here, andyet a moment ago you were in my mind. Last night I dreamt that I became afirefly. It was all very real and very beautiful, and while I was dartinghither and thither I saw you, and flew toward you, intending to tell youthat I had learnt to fly, but you thrust me aside with your stick, and theincident still frightens me."The young man, having heard these words from the lips of his betrothed,held his peace.
