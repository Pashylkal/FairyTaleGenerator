Adam and Eve were standing on the bank of a brook, and before them laythe corpse of Abel, who had been killed by Cain. As they sat there, notknowing what they should do with the corpse, suddenly a little bird fellfrom a nearby tree. The little bird was still very young and could notfly. The fall killed it. Adam and Eve looked at the dead bird and saw thatit was a raven. Soon the old raven flew by, and when he saw that his youngone was dead, he scratched a hole in the ground with his feet, and laid itinside. Then he scratched the hole full and flew away. Adam and Eveobserved all this and followed the raven's example. They made a hole inthe earth, laid Abel's corpse in it, and covered it with earth. This wasthe first human grave.
