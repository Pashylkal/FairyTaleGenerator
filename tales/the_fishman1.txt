Somewhere near the mouth of the Fraser River lived a girl who hadrefused all suitors.After a while a man came to visit her, and lay with her at night.The girl said to him, "You must stay until daylight, and show yourselfto my parents."He answered, "No, I am too poor. Your people would not like me."As he continued to come every night, the girl told her parents, andthey were very angry. Then Fish Man caused the sea to recede for manymiles from the village. He let all the freshwater streams dry up, and norain fall. The animals became thirsty, and left the country. The peoplecould get no fish, no game, and no water to drink.The girl told the people, "My lover has done this, because you werewroth with him and refused him."Then the people made a long walk of planks over the mud to the edge ofthe sea. At the end of this they built a large platform of planks, whichthey covered with mats. They heaped many woolen blankets on it. Then theydressed the girl in a fine robe, combed and oiled her hair, painted herface, and put down on her head. Then they placed her on the top of theblankets and left her there. At once the sky became overcast, rain fell,the springs burst out, the streams ran, and the sea came in. The peoplewatched until the sea rose, and floated the platform with the blankets.They saw a man climb up beside the girlThey stood up. and the girl called, "Now all is well. I shall visit yousoon."Night came on, and they saw them no more. In two days she came back,and told the people, "I live below the sea, in the fish country. Thehouses there are just the same as here, and the people live in the sameway."She returned again with her husband bringing presents of fish. Shesaid, "Henceforth people here shall always be able to catch plenty offish."Once more she came to show them her newly born child. After that shereturned to the sea, and was never seen again.
