Once upon a time, when the world was flat and there were no mountains,there lived two brothers, sons of Lumawig, the Great Spirit. The brotherswere fond of hunting, and since no mountains had formed there was no goodplace to catch wild pig and deer, and the older brother said, "Let uscause water to flow over all the world and cover it, and then mountainswill rise up."So they caused water to flow over all the earth, and when it was coveredthey took the head basket (a bamboo basket, in which the heads of victimsare kept prior to the head taking celebration) of the town and set it fora trap. The brothers were very much pleased when they went to look attheir trap, for they had caught not only many wild pigs and deer, but alsomany people.Now Lumawig looked down from his place in the sky and saw that his sonshad flooded the earth and that in all the world there was just one spotwhich was not covered. And he saw that all the people in the world hadbeen drowned except one brother and sister who lived in Pokis.Then Lumawig descended, and he called to the boy and girl, saying, "Oh,you are still alive.""Yes," answered the boy, "we are still alive, but we are very cold."So Lumawig commanded his dog and deer to get fire for the boy and girl.The dog and the deer swam quickly away, but though Lumawig waited a longtime they did not return, and all the time the boy and girl were growingcolder.Finally Lumawig himself went after the dog and the deer, and when hereached them he said, "Why are you so long in bringing the fire to Pokis?Get ready and come quickly while I watch you, for the boy and girl arevery cold."Then the dog and the deer took the fire and started to swim through theflood, but when they had gone only a little way, the fire was put out.Lumawig commanded them to get more fire and they did so, but they swamonly a little way again when that of the deer went out, and that of thedog would have been extinguished also had not Lumawig gone quickly to himand taken it.As soon as Lumawig reached Pokis he built a big fire which warmed thebrother and sister. and the water evaporated so that the world was as itwas before, except that now there were mountains. The brother and sistermarried and had children, and thus there came to be many people on theearth.
