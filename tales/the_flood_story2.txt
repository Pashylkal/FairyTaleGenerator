A long time ago there was a very big crab which crawled into the sea. Andwhen he went in he crowded the water out so that it ran all over the earthand covered all the land.Now about one moon before this happened, a wise man had told the peoplethat they must build a large raft. They did as he commanded and cut manylarge trees, until they had enough to make three layers. These they boundtightly together, and when it was done they fastened the raft with a longrattan cord to a big pole in the earth.Soon after this the floods came. White water poured out of the hills, andthe sea rose and covered even the highest mountains. The people andanimals on the raft were safe, but all the others drowned.When the waters went down and the raft was again on the ground, it wasnear their old home, for the rattan cord had held.But these were the only people left on the whole earth.
