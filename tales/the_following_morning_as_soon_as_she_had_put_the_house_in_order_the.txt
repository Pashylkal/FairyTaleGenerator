girl sat down to spin. Two hours after there arrived some soldiers, andwhen they saw her spinning they seized her, tied her arms and legs,and carried her to the bank of the river, which was swollen by the laterains.When they reached the bank they flung her in, and watched her sink,after which they left her. But Renelde rose to the surface, and thoughshe could not swim she struggled to land.Directly she got home she sat down and began to spin.Again came the two soldiers to the cottage and seized the girl, carriedher to the river bank, tied a stone to her neck and flung her into thewater.The moment their backs were turned the stone untied itself. Reneldewaded the ford, returned to the hut, and sat down to spin.This time the Count resolved to go to Locquignol himself. but, as hewas very weak and unable to walk, he had himself borne in a litter. Andstill the spinner spun.When he saw her he fired a shot at her, as he would have fired at a wildbeast. The bullet rebounded without harming the spinner, who still spunon.Burchard fell into such a violent rage that it nearly killed him. Hebroke the wheel into a thousand pieces, and then fell fainting on theground. He was carried back to the castle, unconscious.The next day the wheel was mended, and the spinner sat down to spin.Feeling that while she was spinning he was dying, the Count ordered thather hands should be tied, and that they should not lose sight of her forone instant.But the guards fell asleep, the bonds loosed themselves, and the spinnerspun on.Burchard had every nettle rooted up for three leagues round. Scarcelyhad they been torn from the soil when they sowed themselves afresh, andgrew as you were looking at them.They sprung up even in the well trodden floor of the cottage, and asfast as they were uprooted the distaff gathered to itself a supply ofnettles, crushed, prepared, and ready for spinning.And every day Burchard grew worse, and watched his end approaching.
