The part of the great Buddha legend referring to the dragon is asfollows:In years gone by, a dragon living in the great sea saw that his wife'shealth was not good. He, seeing her color fade away, said, "My dear, whatshall I get you to eat?"Mrs. Dragon was silent."Just tell me and I will get it," pleaded the affectionate husband."You cannot do it. why trouble?" quoth she."Trust me, and you shall have your heart's desire," said thedragon."Well," I want a monkey's heart to eat.""Why, Mrs. Dragon, the monkeys live in the mountain forests! How can Iget one of their hearts?""Well, I am going to die. I know I am."Forthwith the dragon went on shore, and, spying a monkey on the top ofa tree, said, "Hail, shining one, are you not afraid you will fall?""No, I have no such fear.""Why eat of one tree? Cross the sea and you will find forests of fruitand flowers.""How can I cross?""Get on my back."The dragon with his tiny load went seaward, and then suddenly diveddown."Where are you going?" said the monkey, with the salt water in his eyesand mouth."Oh! my dear sir! my wife is very sad and ill, and has taken a fancy toyour heart.""What shall I do?" thought the monkey. He then spoke, "Illustriousfriend, why did not you tell me? I left my heart on the top of the tree.take me back, and I will get it for Mrs. Dragon."The dragon returned to the shore. As the monkey was tardy in comingdown from the tree, the dragon said, "Hurry up, little friend, I amwaiting."Then the monkey thought within himself, "What a fool this dragonis!"Then Buddha said to his followers, "At this time I was the monkey."
