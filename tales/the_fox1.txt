The fox is the most crafty and cunning of beasts. His tricks and wilesare innumerable.If there are partridges about, he notices the direction in which theywill be likely to run, and then he runs ahead of them and lies down as ifdead, foaming at the mouth. When the birds come to the spot, they thinkhim dead, and peck at him. They dip their bills in the saliva running fromhis mouth, and then he snaps at and catches them.He one day played a similar trick on a peasant woman who was carrying abasketful of live fowls to market. Seeing the way she was going, he ranahead and lay down as above described. When passing the spot she saw him,but did not think it worth her while to stop and skin him. As soon as shewas out of sight the fox jumped up and, making a detour, again ran aheadof her and lay down a second time in the road at a point she would have topass.She was surprised to see him, and said to herself, "Has a pestilencebroken out amongst foxes? Had I skinned the first I saw lying by theroadside it would have been worth my while to stop for this one, but as Idid not do so then, I shall not do so now."She went on her way, and her surprise was unbounded when, after awhile, she noticed what she believed to be a third fox dead on theroadside."Verily I have done wrong," thought she, "to neglect the good thingsAllah has placed in my way. I shall leave my fowls here and secure thepelts of the first two before the others take them."No sooner said than done. but before she had time to return wondering,but empty handed, the cunning fox had secured his prey and departed.
