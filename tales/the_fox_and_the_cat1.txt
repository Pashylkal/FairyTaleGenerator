A fox was boasting to a cat of its clever devices for escaping itsenemies."I have a whole bag of tricks," he said, "which contains a hundred waysof escaping my enemies.""I have only one," said the cat. "But I can generally manage withthat."Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of hounds comingtowards them, and the cat immediately scampered up a tree and hid herselfin the boughs."This is my plan," said the cat. "What are you going to do?"The fox thought first of one way, then of another, and while he wasdebating, the hounds came nearer and nearer, and at last the fox in hisconfusion was caught up by the hounds and soon killed by the huntsmen.Miss Puss, who had been looking on, said, "Better one safe way than ahundred on which you cannot reckon."
