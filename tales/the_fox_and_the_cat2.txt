It happened that the cat met Mr. Fox in the woods. She thought, "He isintelligent and well experienced, and is highly regarded in the world," soshe spoke to him in a friendly manner, "Good day, my dear Mr. Fox. How isit going? How are you? How are you getting by in these hard times?"The fox, filled with arrogance, examined the cat from head to feet, andfor a long time did not know whether he should give an answer. At last hesaid, "Oh, you poor beard licker, you speckled fool, you hungry mousehunter, what are you thinking? Have you the nerve to ask how I am doing?What do you know? How many tricks do you understand?""I understand only one," answered the cat, modestly."What kind of a trick is it?" asked the fox."When the dogs are chasing me, I can jump into a tree and save myself.""Is that all?" said the fox. "I am master of a hundred tricks, and inaddition to that I have a sackful of cunning. I feel sorry for you. Comewith me, and I will teach you how one escapes from the dogs."Just then a hunter came by with four dogs. The cat jumped nimbly up atree, and sat down at its top, where the branches and foliage completelyhid her."Untie your sack, Mr. Fox, untie your sack," the cat shouted to him,but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast."Oh, Mr. Fox," shouted the cat. "You and your hundred tricks are leftin the lurch. If you had been able to climb like I can, you would not havelost your life."
