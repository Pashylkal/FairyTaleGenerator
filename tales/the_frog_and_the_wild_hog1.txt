Once upon a time it was agreed between a frog and a wild hog that theyshould race to the top of a hill. But just as the hog commenced to run,the frog leaped upon his neck, and the hog knew nothing about it, for hedid not feel him at all, being big in the neck, while the frog was solight that his weight did not ruffle a hair.So the wild hog ran, and raced, and galloped, and fumed. and just when hearrived at the goal, the frog leaped off, but the wild hog did not seehim, and so he was forced to say, "Why, you fellow, you have done it."Then he proposed that they should see which of them could leap best. "Justas you please," replied the frog. "Do your best, for if you don't exertyourself you will regret it, so don't have a stomachache for nothing."So the two came to the waterside to try who could leap farthest. And whenthey came there, and the wild hog was just about to do his best, the frogjumped again upon his neck. And again the stupid fellow knew nothing aboutit, for what good is it to be big if one has no sense? And so, when theywere just at the goal, the frog leaped off again, and so he was first,upon which the wild hog foamed at the mouth, and his eyes turned red. Andagain he was astonished to see the frog take it so easily, and said,"There is no getting the better of you, you rascal!"
