In the eastern part of Persia there lived at one time a gardener whoseone joy in life was his flowers and fruit trees. He had neither wife, norchildren, nor friends. nothing except his garden. At length, however, thegood man wearied of having no one to talk to. He decided to go out intothe world and find a friend. Scarcely was he outside the garden before hecame face to face with a bear, who, like the gardener, was looking for acompanion. Immediately a great friendship sprang up between these two.The gardener invited the bear to come into his garden, and fed him onquinces and melons. In return for this kindness, when the gardener laydown to take his afternoon nap, the bear stood by and drove off theflies.One afternoon it happened that an unusually large fly alighted on thegardener's nose. The bear drove it off, but it only flew to the gardener'schin. Again the bear drove it away, but in a few moments it was back oncemore on the gardener's nose. The bear now was filled with rage. With nothought beyond that of punishing the fly, he seized a huge stone, andhurled it with such force at the gardener's nose that he killed not onlythe fly, but the sleeping gardener.It is better to have a wise enemy than a foolish friend.
