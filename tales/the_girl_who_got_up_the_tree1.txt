A girl who was leaving her master's service at a farm in the country toldher sweetheart that she would meet him near a stile where they had metmany times before. This stile was overhung by a tree. The girl got therebefore him and found a hole dug underneath the tree, and a pickaxe andspade lying by the side of the hole. She was much frightened at what shesaw, and got up the tree. After she had been up the tree awhile hersweetheart came, and another man with him.Thinking that the girl had not yet come, the two men began to talk, andthe girl heard her sweetheart say, "She will not come tonight. We'll gohome now, and come back and kill her tomorrow night."As soon as they had gone the girl came down the tree and ran home to herfather. When she had told him what she had seen, the father ponderedawhile and then said to his daughter, "We will have a feast and ask ourfriends, and we will ask thy sweetheart to come and the man that came withhim to the tree."So the two men came along with the other guests. In the evening they beganto ask riddles of each other, but the girl who had got up the tree was thelast to ask hers. She said:I'll rede you a riddle, I'll rede it you right,Where was I last Saturday night?The wind did blow, the leaves did shake,When I saw the hole the fox did make.When the two men who had intended to murder the girl heard this they ranout of the house.
