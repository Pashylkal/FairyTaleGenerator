In the year 1267 in Pforzheim an old woman, driven by greed, sold aninnocent seven year old girl to the Jews. The Jews gagged her to keep herfrom crying out, cut open her veins, and surrounded her in order to catchher blood with cloths. The child soon died from the torture, and theyweighted her down with stones and threw her into the Enz River.A few days later little Margaret reached her little hand above thestreaming water. A number of people, including the Margrave himself soonassembled. Some boatmen succeeded in pulling the child out of the water.She was still alive, but as soon as she had called for vengeance againsther murderers, she died.Suspicion fell upon the Jews, and they were all summoned to appear. Asthey approached the corpse, blood began to stream from its open wounds.The Jews and the old woman confessed the evil deed and were executed. Thechild's coffin, with an inscription, stands next to the bell rope near theentrance to the palace church at Pforzheim.Children of the members the boatmen's guild unanimously pass the legendfrom generation to generation that at that time the Margrave rewardedtheir ancestors by freeing them from sentry duty in the city of Pforzheim"as long as the sun and the moon continue to shine." At the same time theywere given the right to be represented by twenty four boatmen, carryingarms and musical instruments, who parade and stand watch over the cityevery year at the Carnival celebration. This privilege applies even tothis day.
