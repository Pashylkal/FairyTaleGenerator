Two girls, all dressed up, were walking along playfully andmischievously one evening when suddenly a gigantic fat toad waddled acrosstheir path. The girls joked about the large animal: One of them said thatif it ever had a baby, she would be its godmother. The other one quicklyadded that she would cook for the occasion.A few days afterward, late in the evening, an old woman knocked at thecottage door of the two girls, reminded them of their promise, and askedthem to come to the baptism of the toad's child. They hesitated a longtime, but fear finally drove the mischievous pair out into the night andthe fog. The old woman led them to a remote place where the ceremony wastaking place. A woman was there with a newborn child, and surrounded byall kinds of strange and unusual guests. Sighing, the two girls did whatthey had promised to do. As they were discharged from their duties, thewoman thanked them kindly and gave them an apron filled with coal from thefireplace. The girls did not dare to throw the unwanted gift away, but asthey quickly made their way homeward, they let most of the coal fall tothe ground, paying no attention to a voice that repeatedly sounded frombehind:The more you throw away,The less you will have!When they arrived at home, the little bit of coal that they still hadwas nothing but pure gold.
