One day a countryman going to the nest of his goose found there an eggall yellow and glittering. When he took it up it was as heavy as lead, andhe was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been playedupon him. But he took it home on second thoughts, and soon found to hisdelight that it was an egg of pure gold. Every morning the same thingoccurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs. As he grew rich hegrew greedy. and thinking to get at once all the gold the goose couldgive, he killed it and opened it only to find   nothing.Greed oft o'erreaches itself.
