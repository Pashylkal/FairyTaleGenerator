Some years ago, when driving past a gallows standing in a field atMelton Ross, an old man told me a curious tale. He said, "Some hundred ofyears ago, three or four boys were playing at hanging, and seeing whocould hang the longest in a tree. Just as one of them got up and put thenoose on, a three legged hare (the devil, sir) came limping past, and offthe other lads ran after him, and forgot their comrade. They very nearlycaught the hare several times, but he got away. And when they came backthe lad in the tree was dead. That's what the gallows was put up for."
