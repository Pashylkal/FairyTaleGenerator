A hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the tortoise. Thelatter, laughing, said, "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat youin a race." The hare, deeming her assertion to be simply impossible,assented to the proposal. and they agreed that the fox should choose thecourse, and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race they startedtogether. The tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slowbut steady pace straight to the end of the course. The hare, trusting tohis native swiftness, cared little about the race, and lying down by thewayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as hecould, he saw the tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortablydozing after her fatigue.
