The hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals. "Ihave never yet been beaten," said he, "when I put forth my full speed. Ichallenge anyone here to race with me."The tortoise said quietly, "I accept your challenge.""That is a good joke," said the hare. "I could dance around you all theway.""Keep your boasting until you've beaten," answered the tortoise. "Shallwe race?"So a course was fixed and a start was made. The hare darted almost outof sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for thetortoise, lay down to have a nap. The tortoise plodded on and plodded on,and when the hare awoke from his nap, he saw the tortoise nearing thefinish line, and he could not catch up in time to save the race.Moral: Plodding wins the race.
