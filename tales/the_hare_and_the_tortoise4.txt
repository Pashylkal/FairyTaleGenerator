A hare insulted a tortoise on account of his slowness, and vainly boastedof her own great speed in running."Let us make a match," replied the tortoise. "I'll run you five miles forfive pounds, and the fox yonder shall be umpire of the race."The hare agreed, and away they both started together. but the hare, byreason of her exceeding swiftness, outran the tortoise to such a degreethat she made a jest of the matter, and finding herself a little tired,squatted in a tuft of fern that grew by the way, and took a nap, thinkingthat if the tortoise went by, she could at any time fetch him up with allthe ease imaginable.In the meanwhile the tortoise came jogging along at a slow but continuedpace, and the hare, out of too great security and confidence of victory,oversleeping herself, the tortoise arrived at the end of the race first.
