It is a great mistake to think that fairies, witches, magicians, andsuch people lived only in Eastern countries and in such times as thoseof the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid. Fairies and their like belong to everycountry and every age, and no doubt we should see plenty of them now ifwe only knew how.In a large town in Germany there lived, some couple of hundred yearsago, a cobbler and his wife. They were poor and hard working. The mansat all day in a little stall at the street corner and mended any shoesthat were brought him. His wife sold the fruit and vegetables they grewin their garden in the Market Place, and as she was always neat andclean and her goods were temptingly spread out she had plenty ofcustomers.The couple had one boy called Jem. A handsome, pleasant faced boy oftwelve, and tall for his age. He used to sit by his mother in the marketand would carry home what people bought from her, for which they oftengave him a pretty flower, or a slice of cake, or even some small coin.One day Jem and his mother sat as usual in the Market Place with plentyof nice herbs and vegetables spread out on the board, and in somesmaller baskets early pears, apples, and apricots. Jem cried his waresat the top of his voice:'This way, gentlemen! See these lovely cabbages and these fresh herbs!Early apples, ladies. early pears and apricots, and all cheap. Come,buy, buy!'As he cried an old woman came across the Market Place. She looked verytorn and ragged, and had a small sharp face, all wrinkled, with redeyes, and a thin hooked nose which nearly met her chin. She leant ona tall stick and limped and shuffled and stumbled along as if she weregoing to fall on her nose at any moment.In this fashion she came along till she got to the stall where Jem andhis mother were, and there she stopped.'Are you Hannah the herb seller?' she asked in a croaky voice as herhead shook to and fro.'Yes, I am,' was the answer. 'Can I serve you?''We'll see. we'll see! Let me look at those herbs. I wonder if you'vegot what I want,' said the old woman as she thrust a pair of hideousbrown hands into the herb basket, and began turning over all the neatlypacked herbs with her skinny fingers, often holding them up to her noseand sniffing at them.The cobbler's wife felt much disgusted at seeing her wares treated likethis, but she dared not speak. When the old hag had turned over thewhole basket she muttered, 'Bad stuff, bad stuff. much better fiftyyears ago all bad.'This made Jem very angry'You are a very rude old woman,' he cried out. 'First you mess all ournice herbs about with your horrid brown fingers and sniff at them withyour long nose till no one else will care to buy them, and then you sayit's all bad stuff, though the duke's cook himself buys all his herbsfrom us.'The old woman looked sharply at the saucy boy, laughed unpleasantly, andsaid:'So you don't like my long nose, sonny? Well, you shall have oneyourself, right down to your chin.'As she spoke she shuffled towards the hamper of cabbages, took up oneafter another, squeezed them hard, and threw them back, muttering again,'Bad stuff, bad stuff.''Don't waggle your head in that horrid way,' begged Jem anxiously. 'Yourneck is as thin as a cabbage stalk, and it might easily break and yourhead fall into the basket, and then who would buy anything?''Don't you like thin necks?' laughed the old woman. 'Then you sha'n'thave any, but a head stuck close between your shoulders so that it maybe quite sure not to fall off.''Don't talk such nonsense to the child,' said the mother at last.'If you wish to buy, please make haste, as you are keeping othercustomers away.''Very well, I will do as you ask,' said the old woman, with an angrylook. 'I will buy these six cabbages, but, as you see, I can only walkwith my stick and can carry nothing. Let your boy carry them home for meand I'll pay him for his trouble.'The little fellow didn't like this, and began to cry, for he was afraidof the old woman, but his mother ordered him to go, for she thoughtit wrong not to help such a weakly old creature. so, still crying, hegathered the cabbages into a basket and followed the old woman acrossthe Market Place.It took her more than half an hour to get to a distant part of thelittle town, but at last she stopped in front of a small tumble downhouse. She drew a rusty old hook from her pocket and stuck it into alittle hole in the door, which suddenly flew open. How surprised Jemwas when they went in! The house was splendidly furnished, the walls andceiling of marble, the furniture of ebony inlaid with gold and preciousstones, the floor of such smooth slippery glass that the little fellowtumbled down more than once.The old woman took out a silver whistle and blew it till the sound rangthrough the house. Immediately a lot of guinea pigs came running downthe stairs, but Jem thought it rather odd that they all walked on theirhind legs, wore nutshells for shoes, and men's clothes, whilst eventheir hats were put on in the newest fashion.'Where are my slippers, lazy crew?' cried the old woman, and hit aboutwith her stick. 'How long am I to stand waiting here?'They rushed upstairs again and returned with a pair of cocoa nuts linedwith leather, which she put on her feet. Now all limping and shufflingwas at an end. She threw away her stick and walked briskly across theglass floor, drawing little Jem after her. At last she paused in a roomwhich looked almost like a kitchen, it was so full of pots and pans, butthe tables were of mahogany and the sofas and chairs covered with therichest stuffs.'Sit down,' said the old woman pleasantly, and she pushed Jem intoa corner of a sofa and put a table close in front of him. 'Sit down,you've had a long walk and a heavy load to carry, and I must give yousomething for your trouble. Wait a bit, and I'll give you some nicesoup, which you'll remember as long as you live.'So saying, she whistled again. First came in guinea pigs in men'sclothing. They had tied on large kitchen aprons, and in their belts werestuck carving knives and sauce ladles and such things. After them hoppedin a number of squirrels. They too walked on their hind legs, wore fullTurkish trousers, and little green velvet caps on their heads. Theyseemed to be the scullions, for they clambered up the walls and broughtdown pots and pans, eggs, flour, butter, and herbs, which they carriedto the stove. Here the old woman was bustling about, and Jem could seethat she was cooking something very special for him. At last the brothbegan to bubble and boil, and she drew off the saucepan and poured itscontents into a silver bowl, which she set before Jem.'There, my boy,' said she, 'eat this soup and then you'll haveeverything which pleased you so much about me. And you shall be a clevercook too, but the real herb no, the REAL herb you'll never find. Whyhad your mother not got it in her basket?'The child could not think what she was talking about, but he quiteunderstood the soup, which tasted most delicious. His mother had oftengiven him nice things, but nothing had ever seemed so good as this. Thesmell of the herbs and spices rose from the bowl, and the soup tastedboth sweet and sharp at the same time, and was very strong. As he wasfinishing it the guinea pigs lit some Arabian incense, which graduallyfilled the room with clouds of blue vapour. They grew thicker andthicker and the scent nearly overpowered the boy. He reminded himselfthat he must get back to his mother, but whenever he tried to rousehimself to go he sank back again drowsily, and at last he fell soundasleep in the corner of the sofa.Strange dreams came to him. He thought the old woman took off all hisclothes and wrapped him up in a squirrel skin, and that he went aboutwith the other squirrels and guinea pigs, who were all very pleasant andwell mannered, and waited on the old woman.First he learned to clean her cocoa nut shoes with oil and to rub themup. Then he learnt to catch the little sun moths and rub them throughthe finest sieves, and the flour from them he made into soft bread forthe toothless old woman.In this way he passed from one kind of service to another, spending ayear in each, till in the fourth year he was promoted to the kitchen.Here he worked his way up from under scullion to head pastrycook, andreached the greatest perfection. He could make all the most difficultdishes, and two hundred different kinds of patties, soup flavouredwith every sort of herb he had learnt it all, and learnt it well andquickly.When he had lived seven years with the old woman she ordered him oneday, as she was going out, to kill and pluck a chicken, stuff it withherbs, and have it very nicely roasted by the time she got back. He didthis quite according to rule. He wrung the chicken's neck, plunged itinto boiling water, carefully plucked out all the feathers, and rubbedthe skin nice and smooth. Then he went to fetch the herbs to stuff itwith. In the store room he noticed a half opened cupboard which he didnot remember having seen before. He peeped in and saw a lot of basketsfrom which came a strong and pleasant smell. He opened one and found avery uncommon herb in it. The stems and leaves were a bluish green, andabove them was a little flower of a deep bright red, edged with yellow.He gazed at the flower, smelt it, and found it gave the same strongstrange perfume which came from the soup the old woman had made him. Butthe smell was so sharp that he began to sneeze again and again, and atlast he woke up!There he lay on the old woman's sofa and stared about him in surprise.'Well, what odd dreams one does have to be sure!' he said to himself.'Why, I could have sworn I had been a squirrel, a companion of guineapigs and such creatures, and had become a great cook, too. How motherwill laugh when I tell her! But won't she scold me, though, for sleepingaway here in a strange house, instead of helping her at market!'He jumped up and prepared to go: all his limbs still seemed quite stiffwith his long sleep, especially his neck, for he could not move his headeasily, and he laughed at his own stupidity at being still so drowsythat he kept knocking his nose against the wall or cupboards. Thesquirrels and guinea pigs ran whimpering after him, as though they wouldlike to go too, and he begged them to come when he reached the door, butthey all turned and ran quickly back into the house again.The part of the town was out of the way, and Jem did not know the manynarrow streets in it and was puzzled by their windings and by the crowdof people, who seemed excited about some show. From what he heard, hefancied they were going to see a dwarf, for he heard them call out:'Just look at the ugly dwarf!' 'What a long nose he has, and see how hishead is stuck in between his shoulders, and only look at his ugly brownhands!' If he had not been in such a hurry to get back to his mother, hewould have gone too, for he loved shows with giants and dwarfs and thelike.He was quite puzzled when he reached the market place. There sat hismother, with a good deal of fruit still in her baskets, so he felt hecould not have slept so very long, but it struck him that she was sad,for she did not call to the passers by, but sat with her head resting onher hand, and as he came nearer he thought she looked paler than usual.He hesitated what to do, but at last he slipped behind her, laid a handon her arm, and said: 'Mammy, what's the matter? Are you angry with me?'She turned round quickly and jumped up with a cry of horror.'What do you want, you hideous dwarf?' she cried. 'get away. I can'tbear such tricks.''But, mother dear, what's the matter with you?' repeated Jem, quitefrightened. 'You can't be well. Why do you want to drive your son away?''I have said already, get away,' replied Hannah, quite angrily. 'Youwon't get anything out of me by your games, you monstrosity.''Oh dear, oh dear! she must be wandering in her mind,' murmured the ladto himself. 'How can I manage to get her home? Dearest mother, do lookat me close. Can't you see I am your own son Jem?''Well, did you ever hear such impudence?' asked Hannah, turning to aneighbour. 'Just see that frightful dwarf would you believe that hewants me to think he is my son Jem?'Then all the market women came round and talked all together and scoldedas hard as they could, and said what a shame it was to make game of Mrs.Hannah, who had never got over the loss of her beautiful boy, who hadbeen stolen from her seven years ago, and they threatened to fall uponJem and scratch him well if he did not go away at once.Poor Jem did not know what to make of it all. He was sure he had goneto market with his mother only that morning, had helped to set out thestall, had gone to the old woman's house, where he had some soup and alittle nap, and now, when he came back, they were all talking of sevenyears. And they called him a horrid dwarf! Why, what had happened tohim? When he found that his mother would really have nothing to dowith him he turned away with tears in his eyes, and went sadly down thestreet towards his father's stall.'Now I'll see whether he will know me,' thought he. 'I'll stand by thedoor and talk to him.'When he got to the stall he stood in the doorway and looked in. Thecobbler was so busy at work that he did not see him for some time, but,happening to look up, he caught sight of his visitor, and letting shoes,thread, and everything fall to the ground, he cried with horror: 'Goodheavens! what is that?''Good evening, master,' said the boy, as he stepped in. 'How do you do?''Very ill, little sir, replied the father, to Jem's surprise, for he didnot seem to know him. 'Business does not go well. I am all alone, and amgetting old, and a workman is costly.''But haven't you a son who could learn your trade by degrees?' askedJem.'I had one: he was called Jem, and would have been a tall sturdy ladof twenty by this time, and able to help me well. Why, when he was onlytwelve he was quite sharp and quick, and had learnt many little things,and a good looking boy too, and pleasant, so that customers were takenby him. Well, well! so goes the world!''But where is your son?' asked Jem, with a trembling voice.'Heaven only knows!' replied the man. 'seven years ago he was stolenfrom the market place, and we have heard no more of him.''SEVEN YEARS AGO!' cried Jem, with horror.'Yes, indeed, seven years ago, though it seems but yesterday that mywife came back howling and crying, and saying the child had not comeback all day. I always thought and said that something of the kind wouldhappen. Jem was a beautiful boy, and everyone made much of him, andmy wife was so proud of him, and liked him to carry the vegetables andthings to grand folks' houses, where he was petted and made much of. ButI used to say, "Take care the town is large, there are plenty of badpeople in it keep a sharp eye on Jem." And so it happened. for one dayan old woman came and bought a lot of things more than she could carry.so my wife, being a kindly soul, lent her the boy, and we have neverseen him since.''And that was seven years ago, you say?''Yes, seven years: we had him cried we went from house to house. Manyknew the pretty boy, and were fond of him, but it was all in vain. Noone seemed to know the old woman who bought the vegetables either. onlyone old woman, who is ninety years old, said it might have been thefairy Herbaline, who came into the town once in every fifty years to buythings.'As his father spoke, things grew clearer to Jem's mind, and he saw nowthat he had not been dreaming, but had really served the old woman sevenyears in the shape of a squirrel. As he thought it over rage filled hisheart. Seven years of his youth had been stolen from him, and what hadhe got in return? To learn to rub up cocoa nuts, and to polish glassfloors, and to be taught cooking by guinea pigs! He stood therethinking, till at last his father asked him:'Is there anything I can do for you, young gentleman? Shall I make you apair of slippers, or perhaps' with a smile 'a case for your nose?''What have you to do with my nose?' asked Jem. 'And why should I want acase for it?''Well, everyone to his taste,' replied the cobbler. 'but I must say if Ihad such a nose I would have a nice red leather cover made for it. Hereis a nice piece. and think what a protection it would be to you. As itis, you must be constantly knocking up against things.'The lad was dumb with fright. He felt his nose. It was thick, and quitetwo hands long. So, then, the old woman had changed his shape, and thatwas why his own mother did not know him, and called him a horrid dwarf!'Master,' said he, 'have you got a glass that I could see myself in?''Young gentleman,' was the answer, 'your appearance is hardly one tobe vain of, and there is no need to waste your time looking in a glass.Besides, I have none here, and if you must have one you had betterask Urban the barber, who lives over the way, to lend you his. Goodmorning.'So saying, he gently pushed Jem into the street, shut the door, and wentback to his work.Jem stepped across to the barber, whom he had known in old days.'Good morning, Urban,' said he. 'may I look at myself in your glass fora moment?''With pleasure,' said the barber, laughing, and all the people in hisshop fell to laughing also. 'You are a pretty youth, with your swan likeneck and white hands and small nose. No wonder you are rather vain. butlook as long as you like at yourself.'So spoke the barber, and a titter ran round the room. Meantime Jem hadstepped up to the mirror, and stood gazing sadly at his reflection.Tears came to his eyes.'No wonder you did not know your child again, dear mother,' thought he.'he wasn't like this when you were so proud of his looks.'His eyes had grown quite small, like pigs' eyes, his nose was huge andhung down over his mouth and chin, his throat seemed to have disappearedaltogether, and his head was fixed stiffly between his shoulders. He wasno taller than he had been seven years ago, when he was not much morethan twelve years old, but he made up in breadth, and his back andchest had grown into lumps like two great sacks. His legs were small andspindly, but his arms were as large as those of a well grown man, withlarge brown hands, and long skinny fingers.Then he remembered the morning when he had first seen the old woman, andher threats to him, and without saying a word he left the barber's shop.He determined to go again to his mother, and found her still in themarket place. He begged her to listen quietly to him, and he remindedher of the day when he went away with the old woman, and of many thingsin his childhood, and told her how the fairy had bewitched him, and hehad served her seven years. Hannah did not know what to think the storywas so strange. and it seemed impossible to think her pretty boy andthis hideous dwarf were the same. At last she decided to go and talk toher husband about it. She gathered up her baskets, told Jem to followher, and went straight to the cobbler's stall.'Look here,' said she, 'this creature says he is our lost son. He hasbeen telling me how he was stolen seven years ago, and bewitched by afairy.''Indeed!' interrupted the cobbler angrily. 'Did he tell you this? Wait aminute, you rascal! Why I told him all about it myself only an hour ago,and then he goes off to humbug you. So you were bewitched, my son wereyou? Wait a bit, and I'll bewitch you!'So saying, he caught up a bundle of straps, and hit out at Jem so hardthat he ran off crying.The poor little dwarf roamed about all the rest of the day without foodor drink, and at night was glad to lie down and sleep on the steps of achurch. He woke next morning with the first rays of light, and began tothink what he could do to earn a living. Suddenly he remembered that hewas an excellent cook, and he determined to look out for a place.As soon as it was quite daylight he set out for the palace, for heknew that the grand duke who reigned over the country was fond of goodthings.When he reached the palace all the servants crowded about him, and madefun of him, and at last their shouts and laughter grew so loud that thehead steward rushed out, crying, 'For goodness sake, be quiet, can'tyou. Don't you know his highness is still asleep?'Some of the servants ran off at once, and others pointed out Jem.Indeed, the steward found it hard to keep himself from laughing at thecomic sight, but he ordered the servants off and led the dwarf into hisown room.When he heard him ask for a place as cook, he said: 'You make somemistake, my lad. I think you want to be the grand duke's dwarf, don'tyou?''No, sir,' replied Jem. 'I am an experienced cook, and if you willkindly take me to the head cook he may find me of some use.''Well, as you will. but believe me, you would have an easier place asthe grand ducal dwarf.'So saying, the head steward led him to the head cook's room.'Sir,' asked Jem, as he bowed till his nose nearly touched the floor,'do you want an experienced cook?'The head cook looked him over from head to foot, and burst out laughing.'You a cook! Do you suppose our cooking stoves are so low that you canlook into any saucepan on them? Oh, my dear little fellow, whoever sentyou to me wanted to make fun of you.'But the dwarf was not to be put off.'What matters an extra egg or two, or a little butter or flour and spicemore or less, in such a house as this?' said he. 'Name any dish you wishto have cooked, and give me the materials I ask for, and you shall see.'He said much more, and at last persuaded the head cook to give him atrial.They went into the kitchen a huge place with at least twentyfireplaces, always alight. A little stream of clear water ran throughthe room, and live fish were kept at one end of it. Everything in thekitchen was of the best and most beautiful kind, and swarms of cooks andscullions were busy preparing dishes.When the head cook came in with Jem everyone stood quite still.'What has his highness ordered for luncheon?' asked the head cook.'Sir, his highness has graciously ordered a Danish soup and red Hamburgdumplings.''Good,' said the head cook. 'Have you heard, and do you feel equal tomaking these dishes? Not that you will be able to make the dumplings,for they are a secret receipt.''Is that all!' said Jem, who had often made both dishes. 'Nothingeasier. Let me have some eggs, a piece of wild boar, and such and suchroots and herbs for the soup. and as for the dumplings,' he added in alow voice to the head cook, 'I shall want four different kinds of meat,some wine, a duck's marrow, some ginger, and a herb called heal well.''Why,' cried the astonished cook, 'where did you learn cooking? Yes,those are the exact materials, but we never used the herb heal well,which, I am sure, must be an improvement.'And now Jem was allowed to try his hand. He could not nearly reach up tothe kitchen range, but by putting a wide plank on two chairs he managedvery well. All the cooks stood round to look on, and could not helpadmiring the quick, clever way in which he set to work. At last, whenall was ready, Jem ordered the two dishes to be put on the fire till hegave the word. Then he began to count: 'One, two, three,' till he got tofive hundred when he cried, 'Now!' The saucepans were taken off, and heinvited the head cook to taste.The first cook took a golden spoon, washed and wiped it, and handedit to the head cook, who solemnly approached, tasted the dishes, andsmacked his lips over them. 'First rate, indeed!' he exclaimed. 'Youcertainly are a master of the art, little fellow, and the herb heal wellgives a particular relish.'As he was speaking, the duke's valet came to say that his highness wasready for luncheon, and it was served at once in silver dishes. The headcook took Jem to his own room, but had hardly had time to question himbefore he was ordered to go at once to the grand duke. He hurried on hisbest clothes and followed the messenger.The grand duke was looking much pleased. He had emptied the dishes, andwas wiping his mouth as the head cook came in. 'Who cooked my luncheonto day?' asked he. 'I must say your dumplings are always very good. butI don't think I ever tasted anything so delicious as they were to day.Who made them?''It is a strange story, your highness,' said the cook, and told himthe whole matter, which surprised the duke so much that he sent for thedwarf and asked him many questions. Of course, Jem could not say he hadbeen turned into a squirrel, but he said he was without parents and hadbeen taught cooking by an old woman.'If you will stay with me,' said the grand duke, 'you shall have fiftyducats a year, besides a new coat and a couple of pairs of trousers. Youmust undertake to cook my luncheon yourself and to direct what I shallhave for dinner, and you shall be called assistant head cook.'Jem bowed to the ground, and promised to obey his new master in allthings.He lost no time in setting to work, and everyone rejoiced at having himin the kitchen, for the duke was not a patient man, and had been knownto throw plates and dishes at his cooks and servants if the thingsserved were not quite to his taste. Now all was changed. He nevereven grumbled at anything, had five meals instead of three, thoughteverything delicious, and grew fatter daily.And so Jem lived on for two years, much respected and considered, andonly saddened when he thought of his parents. One day passed much likeanother till the following incident happened.Dwarf Long Nose as he was always called made a practice of doing hismarketing as much as possible himself, and whenever time allowed went tothe market to buy his poultry and fruit. One morning he was in the goosemarket, looking for some nice fat geese. No one thought of laughing athis appearance now. he was known as the duke's special body cook, andevery goose woman felt honoured if his nose turned her way.He noticed one woman sitting apart with a number of geese, but notcrying or praising them like the rest. He went up to her, felt andweighed her geese, and, finding them very good, bought three and thecage to put them in, hoisted them on his broad shoulders, and set off onhis way back.As he went, it struck him that two of the geese were gobbling andscreaming as geese do, but the third sat quite still, only heaving adeep sigh now and then, like a human being. 'That goose is ill,' saidhe. 'I must make haste to kill and dress her.'But the goose answered him quite distinctly:'Squeeze too tightAnd I'll bite,If my neck a twist you gaveI'd bring you to an early grave.'Quite frightened, the dwarf set down the cage, and the goose gazed athim with sad wise looking eyes and sighed again.'Good gracious!' said Long Nose. 'So you can speak, Mistress Goose. Inever should have thought it! Well, don't be anxious. I know betterthan to hurt so rare a bird. But I could bet you were not always in thisplumage wasn't I a squirrel myself for a time?''You are right,' said the goose, 'in supposing I was not born in thishorrid shape. Ah! no one ever thought that Mimi, the daughter of thegreat Weatherbold, would be killed for the ducal table.''Be quite easy, Mistress Mimi,' comforted Jem. 'As sure as I'm an honestman and assistant head cook to his highness, no one shall harm you. Iwill make a hutch for you in my own rooms, and you shall be well fed,and I'll come and talk to you as much as I can. I'll tell all the othercooks that I am fattening up a goose on very special food for the grandduke, and at the first good opportunity I will set you free.'The goose thanked him with tears in her eyes, and the dwarf kept hisword. He killed the other two geese for dinner, but built a little shedfor Mimi in one of his rooms, under the pretence of fattening her underhis own eye. He spent all his spare time talking to her and comfortingher, and fed her on all the daintiest dishes. They confided theirhistories to each other, and Jem learnt that the goose was the daughterof the wizard Weatherbold, who lived on the island of Gothland. Hefell out with an old fairy, who got the better of him by cunning andtreachery, and to revenge herself turned his daughter into a goose andcarried her off to this distant place. When Long Nose told her his storyshe said:'I know a little of these matters, and what you say shows me that youare under a herb enchantment that is to say, that if you can find theherb whose smell woke you up the spell would be broken.'This was but small comfort for Jem, for how and where was he to find theherb?About this time the grand duke had a visit from a neighbouring prince, afriend of his. He sent for Long Nose and said to him:'Now is the time to show what you can really do. This prince who isstaying with me has better dinners than any one except myself, and is agreat judge of cooking. As long as he is here you must take care thatmy table shall be served in a manner to surprise him constantly. Atthe same time, on pain of my displeasure, take care that no dish shallappear twice. Get everything you wish and spare nothing. If you want tomelt down gold and precious stones, do so. I would rather be a poor manthan have to blush before him.'The dwarf bowed and answered:'Your highness shall be obeyed. I will do all in my power to please youand the prince.'From this time the little cook was hardly seen except in the kitchen,where, surrounded by his helpers, he gave orders, baked, stewed,flavoured and dished up all manner of dishes.The prince had been a fortnight with the grand duke, and enjoyed himselfmightily. They ate five times a day, and the duke had every reason tobe content with the dwarf's talents, for he saw how pleased his guestlooked. On the fifteenth day the duke sent for the dwarf and presentedhim to the prince.'You are a wonderful cook,' said the prince, 'and you certainly knowwhat is good. All the time I have been here you have never repeated adish, and all were excellent. But tell me why you have never served thequeen of all dishes, a Suzeraine Pasty?'The dwarf felt frightened, for he had never heard of this Queen ofPasties before. But he did not lose his presence of mind, and replied:'I have waited, hoping that your highness' visit here would last sometime, for I proposed to celebrate the last day of your stay with thistruly royal dish.''Indeed,' laughed the grand duke. 'then I suppose you would have waitedfor the day of my death to treat me to it, for you have never sent itup to me yet. However, you will have to invent some other farewell dish,for the pasty must be on my table to morrow.''As your highness pleases,' said the dwarf, and took leave.But it did not please HIM at all. The moment of disgrace seemed at hand,for he had no idea how to make this pasty. He went to his rooms verysad. As he sat there lost in thought the goose Mimi, who was left freeto walk about, came up to him and asked what was the matter? When sheheard she said:'Cheer up, my friend. I know the dish quite well: we often had it athome, and I can guess pretty well how it was made.' Then she told himwhat to put in, adding: 'I think that will be all right, and if sometrifle is left out perhaps they won't find it out.'Sure enough, next day a magnificent pasty all wreathed round withflowers was placed on the table. Jem himself put on his best clothes andwent into the dining hall. As he entered the head carver was in the actof cutting up the pie and helping the duke and his guests. The grandduke took a large mouthful and threw up his eyes as he swallowed it.'Oh! oh! this may well be called the Queen of Pasties, and at the sametime my dwarf must be called the king of cooks. Don't you think so, dearfriend?'The prince took several small pieces, tasted and examined carefully, andthen said with a mysterious and sarcastic smile:'The dish is very nicely made, but the Suzeraine is not quitecomplete as I expected.'The grand duke flew into a rage.'Dog of a cook,' he shouted. 'how dare you serve me so? I've a good mindto chop off your great head as a punishment.''For mercy's sake, don't, your highness! I made the pasty according tothe best rules. nothing has been left out. Ask the prince what else Ishould have put in.'The prince laughed. 'I was sure you could not make this dish as wellas my cook, friend Long Nose. Know, then, that a herb is wanting calledRelish, which is not known in this country, but which gives the pastyits peculiar flavour, and without which your master will never taste itto perfection.'The grand duke was more furious than ever.'But I WILL taste it to perfection,' he roared. 'Either the pasty mustbe made properly to morrow or this rascal's head shall come off. Go,scoundrel, I give you twenty four hours respite.'The poor dwarf hurried back to his room, and poured out his grief to thegoose.'Oh, is that all,' said she, 'then I can help you, for my father taughtme to know all plants and herbs. Luckily this is a new moon just now,for the herb only springs up at such times. But tell me, are therechestnut trees near the palace?''Oh, yes!' cried Long Nose, much relieved. 'near the lake only a coupleof hundred yards from the palace is a large clump of them. But why doyou ask?''Because the herb only grows near the roots of chestnut trees,' repliedMimi. 'so let us lose no time in finding it. Take me under your arm andput me down out of doors, and I'll hunt for it.'He did as she bade, and as soon as they were in the garden put her onthe ground, when she waddled off as fast as she could towards the lake,Jem hurrying after her with an anxious heart, for he knew that his lifedepended on her success. The goose hunted everywhere, but in vain. Shesearched under each chestnut tree, turning every blade of grass with herbill nothing to be seen, and evening was drawing on!Suddenly the dwarf noticed a big old tree standing alone on the otherside of the lake. 'Look,' cried he, 'let us try our luck there.'The goose fluttered and skipped in front, and he ran after as fast ashis little legs could carry him. The tree cast a wide shadow, and it wasalmost dark beneath it, but suddenly the goose stood still, flappedher wings with joy, and plucked something, which she held out to herastonished friend, saying: 'There it is, and there is more growing here,so you will have no lack of it.'The dwarf stood gazing at the plant. It gave out a strong sweet scent,which reminded him of the day of his enchantment. The stems and leaveswere a bluish green, and it bore a dark, bright red flower with a yellowedge.'What a wonder!' cried Long Nose. 'I do believe this is the very herbwhich changed me from a squirrel into my present miserable form. Shall Itry an experiment?''Not yet,' said the goose. 'Take a good handful of the herb with you,and let us go to your rooms. We will collect all your money and clothestogether, and then we will test the powers of the herb.'So they went back to Jem's rooms, and here he gathered together somefifty ducats he had saved, his clothes and shoes, and tied them all upin a bundle. Then he plunged his face into the bunch of herbs, and drewin their perfume.As he did so, all his limbs began to crack and stretch. he felt his headrising above his shoulders. he glanced down at his nose, and saw it growsmaller and smaller. his chest and back grew flat, and his legs grewlong.The goose looked on in amazement. 'Oh, how big and how beautiful youare!' she cried. 'Thank heaven, you are quite changed.'Jem folded his hands in thanks, as his heart swelled with gratitude. Buthis joy did not make him forget all he owed to his friend Mimi.'I owe you my life and my release,' he said, 'for without you I shouldnever have regained my natural shape, and, indeed, would soon have beenbeheaded. I will now take you back to your father, who will certainlyknow how to disenchant you.'The goose accepted his offer with joy, and they managed to slip out ofthe palace unnoticed by anyone.They got through the journey without accident, and the wizard soonreleased his daughter, and loaded Jem with thanks and valuable presents.He lost no time in hastening back to his native town, and his parentswere very ready to recognise the handsome, well made young man as theirlong lost son. With the money given him by the wizard he opened a shop,which prospered well, and he lived long and happily.I must not forget to mention that much disturbance was caused in thepalace by Jem's sudden disappearance, for when the grand duke sentorders next day to behead the dwarf, if he had not found the necessaryherbs, the dwarf was not to be found. The prince hinted that the dukehad allowed his cook to escape, and had therefore broken his word. Thematter ended in a great war between the two princes, which was known inhistory as the 'Herb War.' After many battles and much loss of life, apeace was at last concluded, and this peace became known as the 'PastyPeace,' because at the banquet given in its honour the prince's cookdished up the Queen of Pasties the Suzeraine and the grand dukedeclared it to be quite excellent.
