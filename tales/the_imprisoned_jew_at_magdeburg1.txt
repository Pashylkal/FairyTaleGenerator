At the time of Bishop Conrad of Magdeburg, who was born a Count ofSternberg, and who died in the year 1278, a Jew fell into a privy on aSaturday. Because it was the Sabbath, the Jews would not pull him out,nor would they allow Christians to do so, because the Jew would have hadto help by grabbing hold with his hands.The Bishop was so outraged by this superstition that the following day,Sunday   the Christian Sabbath, he decreed that the Jews would have tokeep the Christian Sabbath as well. Thus the poor fool had to spend twodays and two nights stuck in a privy.
