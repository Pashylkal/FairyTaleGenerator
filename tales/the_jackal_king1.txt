Once upon a time the jackals assembled together to elect a king forthemselves. The lions had a king. The tigers had a king. The leopards hada king. The wolves had a king. The dogs and other animals had their kings.So they thought that they too ought to appoint one, who should be theirchief, who should guide them in counsel and lead them forth to war."Elect your king," cried the old jackal, anxious to begin the meeting.Whereupon all the jackals shouted, "You are our king! You are our king!You are our senior in age and superior in experience. Who is there so fitas yourself to rule over us?"And the old jackal consented, and by way of distinction allowed his furto be dyed blue, and an old broken winnowing fan to be fastened round hisneck.One day the king was walking about his dominions attended by a largenumber of his jackal subjects, when a tiger suddenly appeared and made arush at them. The whole company fled and forgot their old king. Hismajesty tried to escape into a narrow cave, but alas, his head stuck inthe hole, by reason of the winnowing fan that was around his neck. Seeingtheir leader thus, the tiger came and seized him and carried him away tohis lair, where it fastened him by a rope so that he could not run away.In a short while, however, the jackal king did escape and get back tohis subjects, who again wished him to be their king and to reign overthem.But the jackal had had enough of it, and therefore replied, "No thankyou. I am quite satisfied. Once being a king is quite sufficient for aman's lifetime.
