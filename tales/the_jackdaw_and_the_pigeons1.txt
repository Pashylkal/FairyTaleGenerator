A jackdaw, watching some pigeons in a farmyard, was filled with envywhen he saw how well they were fed, and determined to disguise himself asone of them, in order to secure a share of the good things they enjoyed.So he painted himself white from head to foot and joined the flock. And,so long as he was silent, they never suspected that he was not a pigeonlike themselves. But one day he was unwise enough to start chattering,when they at once saw through his disguise and pecked him so unmercifullythat he was glad to escape and join his own kind again. But the otherjackdaws did not recognize him in his white dress, and would not let himfeed with them, but drove him away. And so he became a homeless wandererfor his pains.
