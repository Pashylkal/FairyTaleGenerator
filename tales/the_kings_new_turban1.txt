Of old time there was a great king. One day a man came before him andsaid, "My king, I shall weave a turban such that one born in wedlock willsee it, while the bastard will see it not."The king marveled and orderedthat that weaver should weave that turban. and the weaver received anallowance from the king and tarried a long while. One day he folded upthis side and that side of a paper and brought it and laid it before theking and said, "Oh king, I have woven that turban."So the king opened thepaper and saw that there was nothing. and all the viziers and nobles whostood there looked on the paper and saw nothing. Then the king said in hisheart, "Do you see? I am then a bastard". and he was sad. And he thought,"Now, the remedy is this, that I say it is a goodly turban and admire it,else will I be put to shame before the folk." And he said, "Blessed byGod! Oh master, it is a goodly turban, I like it much."Then that weaver youth said, "Oh king, let them bring a cap that I maywind the turban for the king."They brought a cap, and the weaver youthlaid that paper before him and moved his hands as though he wound theturban, and he put it on the king's head. All the nobles who were standingthere said, "Blessed be it! Oh king, how fair, how beautiful a turban!"and they applauded it much.Then the king rose and went with two viziers into a private room andsaid, "Oh viziers, I am then a bastard. I see not the turban."The viziers said, "Oh king, we too see it not." At length they knew ofa surety that the turban had not existence, and that that weaver had thusplayed a trick for the sake of money.
