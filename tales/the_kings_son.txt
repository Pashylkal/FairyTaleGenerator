Who rideth through the driving rainAt such a headlong speed?Naked and pale he rides amainUpon a naked steed.Nor hollow nor height his going bars,His wet steed shines like silk,His head is golden to the starsAnd his limbs are white as milk.But, lo, he dwindles as the lightThat lifts from a black mere,And, as the fair youth wanes from sight,The steed grows mightier.What wizard by yon holy treeMutters unto the skyWhere Macha's flame tongued horses fleeOn hoofs of thunder by?Ah, 'tis not holy so to banThe youth of kingly seed:Ah! woe, the wasting of a manWho changes to a steed.Nightly upon the Plain of Kings,When Macha's day is nigh,He gallops. and the dark wind bringsHis lonely human cry.THOMAS BOYD.
