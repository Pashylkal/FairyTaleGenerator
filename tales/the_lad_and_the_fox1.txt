There was once upon a time a little lad, who was on his way to church,and when he came to a clearing in the forest he caught sight of a fox, whowas lying on the top of a big stone fast asleep, so that the fox did notknow the lad had seen him."If I kill that fox," said the lad, taking a heavy stone in his fist,"and sell the skin, I shall get money for it, and with that money I shallbuy some rye, and that rye I shall sow in father's cornfield at home. Whenthe people who are on their way to church pass by my field of rye they'llsay, 'Oh, what splendid rye that lad has got!' Then I shall say to them,'I say, keep away from my rye!' But they won't heed me. Then I shall shoutto them, 'I say, keep away from my rye!' But still they won't take anynotice of me. Then I shall scream with all my might, 'Keep away from myrye!' and then they'll listen to me."But the lad screamed so loudly that the fox woke up and made off atonce for the forest, so that the lad did not even get as much as a handfulof his hair.No, it's best always to take what you can reach, for of undone deedsyou should never screech, as the saying goes.
