Once upon a time there was a lion, who useddaily to devour one of the beasts of theforest. They had to come up one afteranother, when called for. At last it came tothe hare's turn to be eaten, and he did notwant to be eaten at all. He lingered andhe dallied, and when at last he plucked upcourage to come, he was very late. The lion,when he saw the hare coming, boundedtowards him.The hare said, "Uncle Lion, I know I am late, and you havecause to be angry. But really it is not my fault.There is another lion in our part of the jungle, andhe says that he is master, and you are nobody. Infact, when I showed him that I positively would cometo you he was very angry.""Ha!" said the lion, roaring. "Who says he is mymaster? Show him to me. I'll teach him who rulesthe forest.""Come along then," said the hare.They went a long way, until they came to a well.The hare looked down into the well."He was here just now," said he.The Lion looked in, and at the bottom he sawwhat looked like a lion in the water. He shook hismane   the other lion shook his mane. He roared  the echo of a roar came up from the bottom of the well."Let me get at him!" roared the lion.In he jumped   splash! Nothing more was ever heard ofthat lion, and the beasts of the forest were glad tobe left in peace. They put their heads together, andcomposed a verse of poetry, which is always sung inthat forest on Sundays:The hare is small, but by his witHe now has got the best of it.By folly down the lion fell,And lost his life within the well.
