A lion, infirm with age, lay sick in his den, and all the beasts of theforest came to inquire after his health, with theexception of the fox. The wolf thought this was a good opportunity forpaying off old scores against the fox, so he calledthe attention of the lion to his absence, and said, "You see, sire, thatwe have all come to see how you are except the fox,who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care whether you are well orill."Just then the fox came in and heard the last words of the wolf. Thelion roared at him in deep displeasure, but hebegged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, "Not one of themcares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time Ihave been going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for yourillness.""And may I ask if you have found one?" said the lion."I have, sire," said the fox, "and it is this: You must flay a wolf andwrap yourself in his skin while it is stillwarm."The lion accordingly turned to the wolf and struck him dead with oneblow of his paw, in order to try the fox'sprescription. But the fox laughed and said to himself, "That's what comesof stirring ill will."
