There was once a little blackbird (the litia ) who was the proudowner of three kauries , or shells. This bird used to come to a kingand say, "O king, I have three kauries , O king."The king was so much annoyed by the continual chirping of the littlebird that he ordered his servants to take the three kauries fromthe bird and to drive it away.But the bird would not leave the king, and so it began to say, "Mywealth has made you rich, O king. My wealth has made you rich, O king."The king then ordered that the three kauries should be returnedto the little blackbird. The bird then took the three kauries, and went tothe seller of parched gram (a coarse pea), and with the threekauries she bought three grains of parched gram. Taking these thebird flew off and sat on a new cart which a carpenter was making, andthere she started eating the gram. Having eaten two grains, she was aboutto eat the third, when it dropped from her beak and fell into a joint ofthe new cart, where she could not reach it.In great distress she appealed to the carpenter to take to pieces hiscart that she might get at the grain she had lost."You silly little thing," said the carpenter. "Do you suppose I amgoing to take to pieces my new cart to get at a single grain which youhave dropped into the joint of the woodwork?"The little blackbird then went to the king, and said to him that shehad lost her grain, and asked him to order the carpenter to open his cartthat she might get at her grain."You silly little thing," said the king. "Do you suppose I am going toorder the carpenter to open his cart that you may get one smallgrain?"The little blackbird then went to the queen, and begged of her topersuade the king to order the carpenter to open the cart to let her getat the grain. But the queen also said, "Get away, you silly thing."Then the little blackbird went to a deer and said, "Come, O deer, grazein the queen's garden, for she will not persuade the king, and the kingwill not order the carpenter, and the carpenter will not open the cart,and I cannot get at my grain."But the deer would give to heed to the bird, and called her "You sillylittle thing."Then said the bird, "I will go to the lathi (the strong, stoutstick)."To the lathi she went and said, "Come, stout stick, strike thedeer, for the deer will not graze in the queen's garden, and the queenwill not persuade the king, and the king will not command the carpenter,and the carpenter will not open his cart, and I cannot get at mygrain."But the stick also would give no ear to the cry of the littleblackbird, so she went at once to the fire. and she begged the fire toburn the stick, for the deer would not eat the queen's garden, and thequeen would not persuade the king, the king would not command thecarpenter, the carpenter would not break up his cart, and she could notget at her grain.But the fire also made light of the little bird's prayer. So she wentnext to the lake, and implored the lake to quench the fire, for the firewould not burn the stick, and the stick would not strike the deer, and thedeer would not destroy the garden, and the queen would not persuade theking, and the king refused to command the carpenter, who also refused toopen his cart, so that the bird could not get at her grain.But the lake refused to help the bird.She then went to a place where there were thousands of rats, and to therats she presented her prayer that they should come and fill the lake withtheir diggings, for the lake would not quench the fire, etc., etc.But the rats also gave no attention to the wishes of the smallblackbird.Then the bird went to a cat, and of the cat she implored that sheshould attack the rats, for the rats would not fill in the lake, and thelake would not quench the fire, etc., and she could not get at her grain.But the cat also was deaf to the prayers of the small blackbird.Then she went to the elephant, and of the elephant she implored that hewould crush the cat, for the cat would not kill the rats, etc., etc., andshe could not get at her grain.But the elephant treated her as did all the others.Then she went to an ant, and begged the wee ant to crawl into theelephant's ear, for the elephant would not crush the cat, etc., etc. andshe could not get at her grain.But the ant also gave no heed to her prayer.Then at last she came to the crow, the most greedy of all creatures,and of the crow she begged that he should eat the ant.From sheer greed the crow consented to eat the ant. but the ant, seeingthe crow about to eat it, went to crawl into the ear of the elephant, andthe elephant, fearing the harm which the ant could do him, went to crushthe cat. but the cat slipped away, and was about the destroy the rats, andthey at once began to fill in the lake. and the lake, becoming alarmed,was about to quench the fire, when the fire began to burn the stick, andthe stick began to beat the deer, so that the deer was about to destroythe queen's garden, when the queen began to persuade the king, and theking commanded the carpenter, and the carpenter opened his new cart. andthe little blackbird found her grain, and happily taking it up she flewaway, and quietly enjoyed her repast, and lived very happily ever after.
