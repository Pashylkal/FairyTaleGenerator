Many years ago a wicked man lived in a pasture hut. Like other herdsmen,he spent the summer there with his cattle. He was quick tempered andarrogant. He had a poor servant boy, whom he tormented in every possibleway with hard work, rough words, and cruel blows. One day he gave the boya task to do which beyond the his strength. He was then overcome by suchanger that he grabbed the boy and thrust his head into a a kettle of milkthat was being boiled in order to separate it. Thus the boy died, and theherdsman threw his body into a mountain creek. Back at home he said, "Thestupid boy must have been carried away by a rockslide. He went off to milkthe goats, but never came back."Many years passed, and the boys' bones hung unavenged on a cliffy bankof the mountain creek. From time to time a particularly strong rush ofwater would pick up one of the little bones, play with it for a while, andthen leave it lying on a remote bank.Once it happened that there was a fair in the valley. Everyone wasmaking merry. The wicked herdsman, drugged by the wine, music, and dance,had lost all humility and good sense, and was reveling in his sinfulness.It was too hot for him inside, so he went out to the creek, which, swollenby a heavy, warm rain, was rushing by much stronger than usual. He kneeleddown and took off his hat to scoop up some water. He drank the water thathad run into his hat, but at the bottom he found a small white bone. Hestuck it onto his hat and returned to the hall.Suddenly the little bone began to bleed. and now everyone knew what hadhappened to the boy. The festivities were quickly brought to a close, andthe evildoer was taken forthwith to the place of execution.
