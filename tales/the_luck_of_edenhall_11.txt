In an excursion to the North of England, I was easily prevailed upon tosee the Luck of Edenhall ,* (*Edenhall, the antient seat of SirPhilip Musgrave, near Penrith, Cumberland) celebrated in a ballad ofRitson's Select Collection of English Songs. The only description I cangive you of it is, a very thin, bell mouthed, beaker glass, deep andnarrow, ornamented on the outside with fancy work of coloured glass, andmay hold something more than a pint.Antient superstition may have contributed not a little to itspreservation. but that it should not, in a more enlightened age, or inmoments of conviviality (see the Ballad), meet with one gentle rap(and a gentle one would be quite sufficient for an ordinary glassof the same substance), is to me somewhat wonderful. Superstition,however, cannot be entirely eradicated from the mind at once. The lateagent of the family had such a reverential regard for this glass,that he would not suffer any person to touch it, and but few to see it .When the family, or other curious people, had a desire to drink out of it,a napkin was held underneath, less any accident should befall it. and itis still carefully preserved in a case made on purpose. The case is saidto be the second, yet bears the marks of antiquity, and is charged withihs .Tradition, our only guide here, says, that a party of Fairies weredrinking and making merry round a well near the Hall, called St.Cuthbert's well. but, being interrupted by the intrusion of some curiouspeople, they were frightened, and made a hasty retreat, and left the cupin question: one of the last screaming out,If this cup should break or fall,Farewell the Luck of Edenhall.
