Many years ago there lived on the brow of a mountain, in the north ofEngland, an old woman and her daughter. They were very poor, and obligedto work very hard for their living, and the old woman's temper was notvery good, so that the maiden, who was very beautiful, led but an ill lifewith her.The girl, indeed, was compelled to do the hardest work, for her mother gottheir principal means of subsistence by traveling to places in theneighborhood with small articles for sale, and when she came home in theafternoon she was not able to do much more work. Nearly the wholedomestic labor of the cottage devolved therefore on the daughter, the mostwearisome part of which consisted in the necessity of fetching all thewater they required from a well on the other side of the hill, there beingno river or spring near their own cottage.It happened one morning that the daughter had the misfortune, in going tothe well, to break the only pitcher they possessed, and having no otherutensil she could use for the purpose, she was obliged to go home withoutbringing any water. When her mother returned, she was unfortunatelytroubled with excessive thirst, and the girl, though trembling for theconsequences of her misfortune, told her exactly the circumstance that hadoccurred.The old woman was furiously angry, and so far from making any allowancesfor her daughter, pointed to a sieve which happened to be on the table,and told her to go at once to the well and bring her some water in that,or never venture to appear again in her sight.The young maiden, frightened almost out of her wits by her mother's fury,speedily took the sieve, and though she considered the task a hopeless oneto accomplish, almost unconsciously hastened to the well. When shearrived there, beginning to reflect on the painful situation in which shewas placed, and the utter impossibility of her obtaining a living byherself, she threw herself down on the brink of the well in an agony ofdespair.Whilst she was in this condition, a large from came up to the top of thewater, and asked her for what she was crying so bitterly. She wassomewhat surprised at this, but not being the least frightened, told himthe whole story, and that she was crying because she could not carry awaywater in the sieve."Is that all?" said the frog. "cheer up, my hinny! for if you will onlylet me sleep with you for two nights, and then chop off my head, I willtell you how to do it."The maiden thought the frog could not be in earnest, but she was tooimpatient to consider much about it, and at once made the requiredpromise. The frog then instructed her in the following words:Stop with fog (moss),And daub with clay.And that will carryThe water away.Having said this, he dived immediately under the water, and the girl,having followed his advice, got the sieve full of water, and returned homewith it, not thinking much of her promise to the frog. By the time shereached home the old woman's wrath was appeased, but as they were eatingtheir frugal supper very quietly, what should they hear but the splashingand croaking of a frog near the door, and shortly afterwards the daughterrecognized the voice of the frog of the well saying:Open the door, my hinny, my heart,Open the door, my own darling.Remember the word you spoke to meIn the meadow by the well spring.She was now dreadfully frightened, and hurriedly explained the matter toher mother, who was also so much alarmed at the circumstance, that shedared not refuse admittance to the frog, who, when the door was opened,leapt into the room, exclaiming:Go wi' me to bed, my hinny, my heart,Go wi' me to bed, my own darling.Remember the words you spoke to me,In the meadow by the well spring.This command was also obeyed, although as may be readily supposed, she didnot much relish such a bedfellow. The next day, the frog was very quiet,and evidently enjoyed the fare they placed before him, the purest milk andthe finest bread they could procure. In fact, neither the old woman norher daughter spared any pains to render the frog comfortable. That night,immediately supper was finished, the frog again exclaimed:Go wi' me to bed, my hinny, my heart,Go wi' me to bed, my own darling.Remember the words you spoke to me,In the meadow by the well spring.She again allowed the frog to share her couch, and in the morning, as soonas she was dressed, he jumped towards her, saying:Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart,Chop off my head, my own darling.Remember the words you spoke to me,In the meadow by the well spring.The maiden had no sooner accomplished this last request, than in the steadof the frog there stood by her side the handsomest prince in the world,who had long been transformed by a magician, and who could never haverecovered his natural shape until a beautiful virgin had consented, of herown accord, to make him her bedfellow for two nights. the joy of allparties was complete. the girl and the prince were shortly afterwardsmarried, and lived for many years in the enjoyment of every happiness.
