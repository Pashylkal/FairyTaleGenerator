A countryman's son by accident trod upon a serpent's tail, which turnedand bit him so that he died. The father in a rage got his ax, and pursuingthe serpent, cut off part of its tail. So the serpent in revenge beganstinging several of the farmer's cattle and caused him severe loss. Well,the farmer thought it best to make it up with the serpent, and broughtfood and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said to it, "Let's forget andforgive. Perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on mycattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him. Now that we areboth satisfied, why should not we be friends again?""No, no," said the serpent. "Take away your gifts. You can never forgetthe death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail.Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.
