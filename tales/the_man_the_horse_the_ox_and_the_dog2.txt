One winter's day, during a severe storm, a horse, an ox, and a dog cameand begged for shelter in the house of a man. He readily admitted them,and, as they were cold and wet, he lit a fire for their comfort. and heput oats before the horse, and hay before the ox, while he fed the dogwith the remains of his own dinner.When the storm abated, and they were about to depart, they determined toshow their gratitude in the following way. They divided the life of manamong them, and each endowed one part of it with the qualities which werepeculiarly his own. The horse took youth, and hence young men are highmettled and impatient of restraint. the ox took middle age, andaccordingly men in middle life are steady and hard working. while the dogtook old age, which is the reason why old men are so often peevish and illtempered, and, like dogs, attached chiefly to those who look to theircomfort, while they are disposed to snap at those who are unfamiliar ordistasteful to them.
