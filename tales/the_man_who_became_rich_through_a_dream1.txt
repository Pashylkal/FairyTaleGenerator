Once there lived in Baghdad a wealthy man who lost all his means and wasthus forced to earn his living by hard labor. One night a man came tohim in a dream, saying, "Your fortune is in Cairo. go there and seekit." So he set out for Cairo. He arrived there after dark and tookshelter for the night in a mosque. As Allah would have it, a band ofthieves entered the mosque in order to break into an adjoining house.The noise awakened the owners, who called for help. The Chief of Policeand his men came to their aid. The robbers escaped, but when the policeentered the mosque they found the man from Baghdad asleep there. Theylaid hold of him and beat him with palm rods until he was nearly dead,then threw him into jail.Three days later the Chief of Police sent for him and asked, "Where doyou come from?""From Baghdad," he answered."And what brought you to Cairo?""A man came to me in a dream and told me to come to Cairo to find myfortune," answered the man from Baghdad "But when I came here, thepromised fortune proved to be the palm rods you so generously gave to me.""You fool," said the Chief of Police, laughing until his wisdom teethshowed. "A man has come to me three times in a dream and has described ahouse in Baghdad where a great sum of money is supposedly buried beneatha fountain in the garden. He told me to go there and take it, but Istayed here. You, however, have foolishly journeyed from place to placeon the faith of a dream which was nothing more than a meaninglesshallucination." He then gave him some money saying, "This will help youreturn to your own country."The man took the money. He realized that the Chief of Police had justdescribed his own house in Baghdad, so he forthwith returned home, wherehe discovered a great treasure beneath the fountain in his garden. ThusAllah gave him abundant fortune and brought the dream's prediction tofulfillment.
