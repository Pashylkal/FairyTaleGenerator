One day a man who had been to gather his coconuts loaded his horse heavilywiththe fruit. On the way home he met a boy whom he asked how long it wouldtake toreach the house."If you go slowly," said the boy, looking at the load on the horse, "youwillarrive very soon. but if you go fast, it will take you all day."The man could not believe this strange speech, so he hurried his horse.But thecoconuts fell off and he had to stop to pick them up. Then he hurried hishorseall the more to make up for lost time, but the coconuts fell off again.Manytime he did this, and it was night when he reached home.
