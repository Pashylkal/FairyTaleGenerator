and when they halted, Selim the Stranger began thus to speak to Muley,the youngest of the merchants:"You are, indeed, the youngest of us, nevertheless you are always infine spirits, and, to a certainty, know for us, some right merrystory. Out with it then, that it may refresh us after the heat of theday.""I might easily tell you something," answered Muley, "which wouldamuse you, nevertheless modesty becomes youth in all things. thereforemust my older companions have the precedence. Zaleukos is ever sograve and reserved. should not he tell us what has made his life soserious? Perhaps we could assuage his grief, if such he have. forgladly would we serve a brother, even if he belong to another creed."The person alluded to was a Grecian merchant of middle age, handsomeand strongly built, but very serious. Although he was an unbeliever,(that is, no Mussulman,) still his companions were much attached tohim, for his whole conduct had inspired them with respect andconfidence. He had only one hand, and some of his companionsconjectured that, perhaps, this loss gave so grave a tone to hischaracter. Zaleukos thus answered Muley's friendly request:"I am much honored by your confidence: grief have I none, at leastnone from which, even with your best wishes, you can relieve me.Nevertheless, since Muley appears to blame me for my seriousness, Iwill relate to you something which will justify me when I am moregrave than others. You see that I have lost my left hand. this camenot to me at my birth, but I lost it in the most unhappy days of mylife. Whether I bear the fault thereof, whether I am wrong to be moreserious than my condition in life would seem to make me, you mustdecide, when I have told you the STORY OF THE HEWN OFF HAND."
