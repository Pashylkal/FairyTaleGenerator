And this is why to day thecountry boys always throw stones at a titmouse.On the evening of the wedding day all the larders, cellars, cupboardsand tables of the people, whether rich or poor, were loaded as if byenchantment with bread, wine, beer, cakes and tarts, roast larks, andeven geese, so that Tubby could not complain any more that his son hadmarried Famine.Since that time there has always been plenty to eat in that country, andsince that time, too, you see in the midst of the fair haired blue eyedwomen of Flanders a few beautiful girls, whose eyes are black and whoseskins are the colour of gold. They are the descendants of Zizi.(21)(21) Charles Deulin, Contes du Roi Gambrinus.
