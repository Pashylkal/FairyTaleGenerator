There was war between the mice and the weasels, in which the mice alwaysgot the worst of it, numbers of them beingkilled and eaten by the weasels. So they called a council of war, in whichan old mouse got up and said, "It's nowonder we are always beaten, for we have no generals to plan our battlesand direct our movements in the field."Acting on his advice, they chose the biggest mice to be their leaders, andthese, in order to be distinguished fromthe rank and file, provided themselves with helmets bearing large plumesof straw. They then led out the mice tobattle, confident of victory. but they were defeated as usual, and weresoon scampering as fast as they could to theirholes. All made their way to safety without difficulty except the leaders,who were so hampered by the badges of theirrank that they could not get into their holes, and fell easy victims totheir pursuers.Moral: Greatness carries its own penalties.
