Once upon a time all the mice met together in council and discussed thebest means of securing themselves against theattacks of the cat. After several suggestions had been debated, a mouse ofsome standing and experience got up andsaid, "I think I have hit upon a plan which will ensure our safety in thefuture, provided you approve and carry itout. It is that we should fasten a bell round the neck of our enemy thecat, which will by its tinkling warn us of herapproach." This proposal was warmly applauded, and it had been alreadydecided to adopt it, when an old mouse got uponhis feet and said, "I agree with you all that the plan before us is anadmirable one. But may I ask who is going tobell the cat?"
