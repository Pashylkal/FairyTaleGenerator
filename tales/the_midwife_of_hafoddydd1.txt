Once on a time, when a midwife from Nanhwynan had newly got to theHafoddydd Brithion to pursue her calling, a gentleman came to the door ona fine gray steed and bade her come with him at once. Such was theauthority with which he spoke, that the poor midwife durst not refuse togo, however much it was her duty to stay where she was. So she mountedbehind him, and off the went, like the flight of a swallow, throughCwmllan, over the Bwlch, down Nant yr Aran, and over the Gader to CwmHafod Ruffydd, before the poor woman had time even to say "Oh!"When they reached there, she saw before her a magnificent mansion,splendidly lit up with such lamps as she had never seen before. Theyentered the court, and a crowd of servants in expensive liveries came tomeet them, and she was at once led through the great hall into abed chamber, the like of which she had never seen. There the mistress ofthe house, to whom she had been fetched, was awaiting her.The midwife got through her duties successfully, and stayed there untilthe lady had completely recovered, nor had she spent any part of her lifeso merrily, for there naught but festivity went on day and night:dancing, singing, and endless rejoicing reigned there. But merry as itwas, she found that she must go, and the nobleman gave her a large purse,with the order not to open it until she had got into her own house. Thenhe bade one of his servants escort her the same way that she had come.When she reached home she opened the purse, and, to her great joy, it wasfull of money.She lived happily on those earnings to the end of her life.
