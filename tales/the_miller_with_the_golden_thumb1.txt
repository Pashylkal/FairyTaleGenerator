A merchant that thought to deride a miller sitting among company saidto him, "Sir, I have heard that every honest miller that tells the truthhas a golden thumb."The miller answered and said it was true.Then the merchant said, "I pray, let me see your thumb." And when themiller showed his thumb, the merchant said, "I cannot perceive that yourthumb is gold. It is the same as other men's thumbs."The miller answered, and said, "Sir, the truth is that my thumb isgold, but you have no power to see it, for it has the property that he whois a cuckold shall never have power to see it."
