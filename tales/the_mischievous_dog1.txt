There was once a dog who used to snap at people and bite them without anyprovocation, and who was a great nuisance toeveryone who came to his master's house. So his master fastened a bellround his neck to warn people of his presence.The dog was very proud of the bell, and strutted about tinkling it withimmense satisfaction. But an old dog came upto him and said, "The fewer airs you give yourself the better, my friend.You don't think, do you, that your bell wasgiven you as a reward of merit? On the contrary, it is a badge ofdisgrace."Moral: Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.
