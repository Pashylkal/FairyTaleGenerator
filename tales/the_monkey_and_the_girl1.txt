Once upon a time the boys and girls of a village used to watch thecrops of but (a kind of grain) growing by a river, and there was aHanuman monkey who wished to eat the but , but they drove him away.So he made a plan. He used to make a garland of flowers and go with itto the field, and, when he was driven away, he would leave the flowersbehind. And the children were pleased with the flowers and ended by makingfriends with the monkey and did not drive him away.There was one of the young girls who was fascinated by the monkey andpromised to marry him. Some of the other children told this in thevillage, and the girl's father and mother came to hear of it and wereangry, and the father took some of the villagers and went and shot themonkey.Then they decided not to throw away the body, but to burn it like thecorpse of a man. So they made a pyre and put the body on it and set fireto it. Just then the girl came, and they told her to go away, but she saidthat she wished to see whether they really burned him like a man. So shestood by, and when the pyre was in full blaze, she called out, "Oh lookwhat is happening to the stars in the sky!"At this everyone looked up at the sky. Then she took some sand whichshe had in the fold of her cloth and threw it into the air, and it fellinto their eyes and blinded them.While they were rubbing the sand out of their eyes the girl leapt ontothe pyre, and was burned along with the monkey and died a sati(also spelled suttee   a Hindu widow's suicidal cremation onher husband's funeral pyre as a demonstration of devotion). Her father andbrothers were very angry at this and said that the girl must have had amonkey's soul, and so she was fascinated by him. And so saying they bathedand went home.
