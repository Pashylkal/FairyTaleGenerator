In long past times there lived a band of monkeys in a forest. As theyrambled about they saw the reflection of the moon in a well, and theleader of the band said, "O friends, the moon has fallen into the well .The world is now without a moon. Ought not we to draw it out?"The monkeys said, "Good. we will draw it out."So they began to hold counsel as to how they were to draw it out. Some ofthem said, "Do not you know? The monkeys must form a chain, and so drawthe moon out."So they formed a chain, the first monkey hanging on to the branch of atree, and the second to the first monkey's tail, and a third one in itsturn to the tail of the second one. When in this way they were all hangingon to one another, the branch began to bend a good deal. The water becametroubled, the reflection of the moon disappeared, the branch broke, andall the monkeys fell into the well and were disagreeably damaged.A deity uttered this verse, "When the foolish have a foolish leader, theyall go to ruin, like the monkeys which wanted to draw the moon up from thewell."
