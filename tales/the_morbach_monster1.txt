Have you ever heard of the Morbach Monster?I first learned of the legend while I was stationed at Hahn Airforce Base,Germany. Morbach was a munitions site just outside of the villiage ofWittlich.Supposedly Wittlich is the last town where a werewolf was killed. There isa shrine just outside of town where a candle always burns. Legend has itthat if the candle ever goes out the werewolf will return.One night a group of security policemen were on the way to their post atMorbach, when they noticed that the candle was out at the shrine, and alljoked about the monster.Later that night alarms were received from a fence line sensor. When thesecurity policemen investigated the call one of them saw a huge "dog like"animal stand up on its back legs, look at him, and jump over the 7 1/2foot chain link fence. A military working dog was brought to the areawhere the creature was last seen, and the dog went nuts, not wantinganything to do with tracking the creature.This occured around 1988.There have always been "ghost" stories dreamed up by bored securitypolicemen, but this is one I have heard over and over again. Thought youmight find it interesting.
