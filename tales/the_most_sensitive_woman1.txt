The parents of a prince wanted him to marry, but he said, "I will marryonly such a woman about whom I can say with good conscience that she isthe most sensitive woman in the world."His parents answered, "Then go and find her!"He went forth and came to a woman whose head was all bandaged up andwho appeared to be suffering. "What is the matter with you?" he asked."Oh," she said, "this morning my maid was combing my hair, and shepulled one out, which is causing me great pain."But the prince thought to himself, "She isn't the right one. I willseek further."He went on his way and found another woman. Her entire body was wrappedwith the finest linen, and she looked very sad. "What is the matter withyou?" he asked."Oh," she said, "last night while I was in bed there was a littlewrinkle in the sheet I was lying on, and it has made me sick."But the prince thought, "She is not the most sensitive one either.There must be a better one."He continued on his way and came to a third woman. She was sitting inan easy chair and had a bandaged foot. She was crying bright tears and wasdistorting her pretty face until one had to feel sorry for her. "What isthe matter with you?" asked the prince."Oh," she groaned, "this morning while I was strolling in the garden alittle breeze came up and blew the petal of a jasmine blossom onto myfoot."The prince thought about this a little while, and then said, "You arethe right one, for there cannot be a more sensitive woman than you!" Andhe married her.Did he do the right thing? Unfortunately the storyteller does not know,for she has run out of yarn.
