A mouse and a frog struck up a friendship. They were not well mated,for the mouse lived entirely on land, while the frog was equally at homeon land or in the water. In order that they might never be separated, thefrog tied himself and the mouse together by the leg with a piece ofthread. As long as they kept on dry land all went fairly well. but, comingto the edge of a pool, the frog jumped in, taking the mouse with him, andbegan swimming about and croaking with pleasure. The unhappy mouse,however, was soon drowned, and floated about on the surface in the wake ofthe frog. There he was spied by a hawk, who pounced down on him and seizedhim in his talons. The frog was unable to loose the knot which bound himto the mouse, and thus was carried off along with him and eaten by thehawk.
