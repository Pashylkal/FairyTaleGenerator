Once upon a time there was a shepherd who had a large, large herd ofsheep which he was moving over hill and dale, far out into the world. Theycame to a deep body of water, over which there was fortunately a bridge.However, the bridge was tiny and narrow, so that only a single sheep couldgo across it. And another sheep could not even step onto the bridge untilthe sheep in front was all the way across, or the bridge certainly wouldhave broken. Just think how long it will take until all of the many, manysheep have crossed over.So, you see, we must wait until they are all on the other side with theshepherd, and that will take a while yet, and then I will continue with mystory about the shepherd and his large, large herd of sheep.
