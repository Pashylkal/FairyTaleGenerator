When I was a little girl, 'twas out near Loop Head I live. Well, there wasan old woman lived in a small little cabin by herself, and all theneighbors around used to be in dread of her. They said she was chanted(haunted). No one knew how she lived, for she never left the cabin in theday, but they said she used to go out through the fields at night. Nearlyevery week some of the neigbors' milk would be gone, and if it wasn't, ifthey were churning for a month, 'twouldn't make butter.One, a man name of Shawn Teigue Mack, said he would know if 'twas she thatwas taking the butter. So he watched all night at the cabin, and abouttwelve o'clock he saw a hare come out of the house. The very minute it sawShawn, away would it across the field, but Shawn fired, and struck it inthe shoulder.Begor, the next morning tracks of blood was seen along the road to thecabin. What did Shawn do, but call to the cabin, and the door was barredfrom inside. But he shoved in the window, and sure enough, there was theold dame, and all her shoulder wrapped up in calico. She left the placeshortly after, for she knew she was found out, and no one ever missedbutter or milk after.
