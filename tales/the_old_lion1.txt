A lion, enfeebled by age and no longer able to procure food for himself byforce, determined to do so by cunning.Betaking himself to a cave, he lay down inside and feigned to be sick. andwhenever any of the other animals enteredto inquire after his health, he sprang upon them and devoured them. Manylost their lives in this way, till one day afox called at the cave, and, having a suspicion of the truth, addressedthe lion from outside instead of going in, andasked him how he did. He replied that he was in a very bad way. "But,"said he, "why do you stand outside? Pray comein." "I should have done so," answered the fox, "if I hadn't noticed thatall the footprints point towards the caveand none the other way."
