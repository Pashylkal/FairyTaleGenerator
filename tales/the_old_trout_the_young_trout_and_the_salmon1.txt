A fisherman, in the month of May, stood angling on the bank of a riverwith an artificial fly. He threw his bait withso much art that a young trout was rushing towards it, when she wasprevented by her mother. "Stop, child!" said she."Never be too hasty where there is a possibility of danger. Take due timeto consider, before you risk an action thatmay be fatal. How do you know whether that is indeed a fly, or the snareof an enemy? Let someone else make theexperiment before you. If it be a fly, he will very probably elude thefirst attack, and then the second may be madeif not with success, at least with safety."She had no sooner uttered this caution than a salmon seized upon thepretended fly, and was captured.Moral: Do not rush into a strange position.
