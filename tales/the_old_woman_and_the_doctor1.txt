An old woman became almost totally blind from a disease of the eyes, and,after consulting a doctor, made an agreementwith him in the presence of witnesses that she should pay him a high feeif he cured her, while if he failed he was toreceive nothing. The doctor accordingly prescribed a course of treatment,and every time he paid her a visit he tookaway with him some article out of the house, until at last, when hevisited her for the last time, and the cure wascomplete, there was nothing left.When the old woman saw that the house was empty she refused to pay him hisfee. and, after repeated refusals on herpart, he sued her before the magistrates for payment of her debt. On beingbrought into court she was ready with herdefense. "The claimant," said she, "has stated the facts about ouragreement correctly. I undertook to pay him a feeif he cured me, and he, on his part, promised to charge nothing if hefailed. Now, he says I am cured. But I say thatI am blinder than ever, and I can prove what I say. When my eyes were badI could at any rate see well enough to beaware that my house contained a certain amount of furniture and otherthings. But now, when according to him I amcured, I am entirely unable to see anything there at all."
