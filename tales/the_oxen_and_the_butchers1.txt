Once upon a time the oxen determined to be revenged upon the butchers forthe havoc they wrought in their ranks, andplotted to put them to death on a given day. They were all gatheredtogether discussing how best to carry out theplan, and the more violent of them were engaged in sharpening their hornsfor the fray, when an old ox got up upon hisfeet and said, "My brothers, you have good reason, I know, to hate thesebutchers, but, at any rate, they understandtheir trade and do what they have to do without causing unnecessary pain.But if we kill them, others, who have noexperience, will be set to slaughter us, and will by their bunglinginflict great sufferings upon us. For you may besure that even though all the butchers perish, mankind will never gowithout their beef."
