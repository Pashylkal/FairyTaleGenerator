A peasant had an apple tree growing in his garden, which bore no fruit,but merely served to provide a shelter fromthe heat for the sparrows and grasshoppers which sat and chirped in itsbranches. Disappointed at its barrenness hedetermined to cut it down, and went and fetched his ax for the purpose.But when the sparrows and the grasshoppers sawwhat he was about to do, they begged him to spare it, and said to him, "Ifyou destroy the tree we shall have to seekshelter elsewhere, and you will no longer have our merry chirping toenliven your work in the garden."He, however, refused to listen to them, and set to work with a will to cutthrough the trunk. A few strokes showedthat it was hollow inside and contained a swarm of bees and a large storeof honey. Delighted with his find he threwdown his ax, saying, "The old tree is worth keeping after all."Moral: Utility is most men's test of worth.
