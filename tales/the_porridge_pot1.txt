Once upon a time there were a man and a woman. One evening they did notknow what to eat. Finally the man spoke, "Wife, let us eat porridge.""No," said the woman, "for then tomorrow I would have to wash out theporridge pot, and I won't do that.""I won't do it either," said the man, and they fell to quarreling whowould have to wash out the porridge pot. Finally they agreed that thefirst one of them to speak would have to wash it out.They ate their porridge and went to bed. The next morning neither ofthem said anything about getting up. Seven o'clock came, eight o'clock,even twelve o'clock, and the two still lay in bed. The neighbors wereconcerned and said to one another, "Robbers must have come and murderedboth of them."So they broke down the door, entered the bedroom, and told them to getup, but received no answer. Then one of the neighbors said, "Wait, let'sfetch the priest so they can say their confessions."The priest came, but they refused to say their confessions, remainingas still as mice. The priest went home, and the two remained lying thereuntil evening, and neither said a word. Then the priest returned andasked, "Have they said anything yet?""No," replied the neighbors."Then stay here and care for them!" said the priest."Yes, and who is going to pay us for it?" asked the neighbors.The priest answered, "You'll be paid. There is a good coat hanging onthe wall over there. Take it and sell it, and then you'll have yourmoney."With that the woman cried out with anger, "What? You want to take mycoat? Take your own things, but leave other people's things to them.""Aha," said the man. "Now go and wash out the porridge pot!" And so thewoman had to wash out the porridge pot.
