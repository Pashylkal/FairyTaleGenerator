One there was a king who had a daughter, being very beautiful, and heloved her so much he wanted to marry her. Here I forget details ,but the princess was in great trouble, especially as she loved a princewho lived a long way off, and he loved her.She had made (or got her father to give her) a beautiful golden cow aslarge as a real one. She made arrangements in some manner ( detailsforgotten ) to have the golden cow conveyed under pretence of its beinga parting gift or token of remembrance to the prince. She got inside it,and went in the cow a long journey by sea.There was a signal prearranged ( details forgotten ) of three knockson the cow to show when she could come out safely. But when she had gone along way the cow was landed (I think the captain of the ship was in thesecret, and was to see to her reaching the prince), but people came to seethe cow, for it was very curious, amongst them three gentlemen who wantedto be able to say they had touched it, and one poked it with his umbrella( sic ), and said, "I've touched the golden cow," and the next pokedit with his umbrella, and said, "I've touched the golden cow," and thethird poked it with his umbrella, and said, "I've touched the golden cow."With that the princess opened the door and came out, for she thought thosethree knocks were the signal. Then the prince turned up, after someadventures that I have forgotten, and all ended happily.
