Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to find a princess, butshe would have to be a real princess. So he traveled all around theworld to find one, but there was always something wrong. There wereprincesses enough, but he could never be sure that they were real ones.There was always something about them that was not quite right. So he camehome again and was sad, for he so much wanted to have a real princess.One evening there was a terrible storm. It thundered and lightninged!The rain poured down! It was horrible! Then there was a knock at the citygate, and the old king went out to open it.A princess was standing outside. But my goodness, how she looked fromthe rain and the weather! Water ran down from her hair and her clothes. Itran into the toes of her shoes and out at the heels. And yet she said thatshe was a real princess."Well, we shall soon find that out," thought the old queen. But shesaid nothing, went into the bedroom, took off all the bedding and laid apea on the bottom of the bed. Then she took twenty mattresses and laidthem on the pea, and then twenty featherbeds of eiderdown on top of themattresses.That was where the princess was to sleep for the night. In the morningshe was asked how she had slept."Oh, horribly!" she said. "I hardly closed my eyes all night. Goodnessknows what there was in the bed! I was lying on something hard, so that Iam black and blue all over my body. It is horrible!"Now they could see that she was a real princess, because she had feltthe pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty featherbeds.Nobody but a real princess could be that sensitive.So the prince took her for his wife, because now he knew that he had areal princess. And the pea was put in the art gallery where it can stillbe seen, unless someone has taken it.Now see, that was a real story!
