Sothere was a river not far away, where water lilies grew.So the tortoise said to the rabbit, "I'll run a race with you." So therabbit laughed at the tortoise. So the rabbit asked where he wanted to runa race to.The tortoise said, "Down to the river, where the water lilies grew."And the rabbit said, "You'll grow old and die before you get there."But the turtle said to the rabbit, "Who shall we have for a judge to thisrace?"An' the rabbit said, "We'll get Mr. Wolf for a judge."So they said, one, two, three, an' away they went. So the rabbit ran rightfast till he got in sight of the river where the water lilies grew. And helay down in the shade to rest. While he was resting, he fell fast asleep.And when he awoke again, it was the next day at dinnertime. So he was veryhungry. and he ran into a near field an' eat some clover, an' he didn'tknow that the tortoise had passed him while he was asleep. So after he hadate his dinner, he ran right fast to the goal. But who should he find whenhe got there, waiting for him, but the tortoise who he had laughed at theday before.
