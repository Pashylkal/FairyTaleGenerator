Once upon a time there was a mother whose only child died. She criedfor it unceasingly. Once she was out in the field and crying again.Suddenly she saw an entire band of lovely angels flying above her, all ofthem young and beautiful, all of them happy and cheerful. Then the motherthought, "Oh, if only my child were also such a little angel!" And shelooked to see if she could not find her child in the band. But she couldnot see it.Then from behind there came a little angel. It was very sad and wascarrying a heavy black jug in its little hands. It was the mother'schild.The mother asked, "My child, why are you not with the happy littleangels?""Mother," it said, "as long as you are crying I must collect your tearsand cannot be happy like the others."From that hour forth the mother cried no more.
