There was once a little girl called Mary who had a satin frock, and hermother told her that if she got a dirty mark on it she would kill her. Oneday as Mary was going a walk, some cows that were passing by splashed herfrock with mud. Then Mary went and sat on a doorstep and began to cry. Thewoman in the house hearing her cry came out, and Mary told her that shedare not go home because she had got her frock dirty, and that her motherhad threatened to kill her if she got it dirty. So the woman took her inand washed the mud from her frock, and then dried it. She then sent thelittle girl on her way, telling her to mind and not get it dirty again,and then her mother would not kill her.So Mary went on her way, but lower down the road a horse that was runningby splashed her frock again. When she got home her mother took her in thecellar and cut her head off, and hung it on the wall.When her father came home he said, "Where is our Mary?"Her mother told him she had gone to her grandmother's to stay all night.When bedtime came he said, "I will fetch the sticks up." but his wifesaid, "No, I will." but he said, "No, I will fetch them up." and she said,"No, I will." but he would not let her fetch them.When he had got down in the cellar he saw the head hung up, so when he hadcome out of the cellar he asked his wife what it was. She told him that itwas a sheep's head that she was going to make some broth of for tomorrow'sdinner.When he came home to dinner next day, he said, "This broth is nice, but itdoes taste like our Mary."When his wife heard this she was very frightened. but when her husbandfound out what had been done he took her in the cellar and killed her.
