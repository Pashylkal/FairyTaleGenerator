Within a savage forest grotA satyr and his chipsWere taking down their porridge hot.Their cups were at their lips.You might have seen in mossy den,Himself, his wife, and brood.They had not tailor clothes, like men,But appetites as good.In came a traveller, benighted,All hungry, cold, and wet,Who heard himself to eat invitedWith nothing like regret.He did not give his host the painHis asking to repeat.But first he blew with might and mainTo give his fingers heat.Then in his steaming porridge dishHe delicately blew.The wondering satyr said, "I wishThe use of both I knew.""Why, first, my blowing warms my hand,And then it cools my porridge.""Ah!" said his host, "then understandI cannot give you storage.To sleep beneath one roof with you,I may not be so bold.Far be from me that mouth untrueWhich blows both hot and cold."
