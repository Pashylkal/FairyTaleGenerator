Old Mr. Hodgson, master of the grammar school at Bury, was enjoying hismidday meal, when his wooden trencher began to turn round, and he wasimmediately convinced that something very wrong was going on in theschoolhouse. So he hastened thither, and found the boys in greatconsternation, for by means of saying the Lord's Prayer backwards they hadraised the devil, and they could not lay him again.Mr. Hodgson knew that the only way to get rid of him would be to give hima task which he could not perform, and that, if in three trials they couldnot hit upon such a task, the case would be hopeless.Mr. Hodgson first desired him to count the blades of grass in the castlecroft. This task the devil performed directly. He was next ordered tocount the grains of sand on the school brow. This gave him no more troublethan the former feat. Only one chance was left. A happy thought occurredto Mr. Hodgson. He commanded the devil to count the letters in the largeBible in the parish church. In an instant the devil descended to the lowerregions through the floor of the school, leaving a great crack on thehearthstone where he passed through, to attest the truth of this story tofuture generations.
