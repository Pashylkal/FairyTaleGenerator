High water and ice on the Haun River so damaged a miller's spillway everywinter that he was no longer able to raise the funds to repair it.Dismayed, one day he was standing at the spillway when he was approachedby a drunkard who offered him advice. He promised to make the spillway sosecure that it would never again be damaged, but the miller would have topay him well.The miller agreed, and the drunkard said, "Find a boy for us. We willbury him alive beneath the foundation stone, and I guarantee thedurability of the spillway."The miller shuddered, but when the drunkard offered to provide a boy forfifteen pecks of groats, he entered into the agreement, and forthwith theydug the grave.The next day the child cried in vain. The two men pushed him into thepit, threw stones in on top of him, and soon the spillway was ready.Soon thereafter the drunkard's corpse was pulled from the Haun River. Themiller's conscience so gnawed at him that he wasted away and then died.From that time forth the miller wanders about, attempting to pullpassersby into the river. Every year he must lure at least one personinto the river. Usually they are drunkards. He is on the lookout forthem, because it was one of their kind who brought misfortune upon him.
