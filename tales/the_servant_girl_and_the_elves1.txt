Once upon a time there was a poor servant girl who was diligent andneat. Every day she swept out the house and shook the sweepings onto alarge pile outside the door. One morning just as she was beginning herwork she found a letter on the pile of sweepings. She could not read, soshe stood her broom in the corner and took the letter to her employers. Itwas an invitation from the elves, asking the girl to serve as godparent atthe baptism of one of their children.At first the girl did not know what she should do, but finally theyconvinced her to accept. It would not be right, they said, to decline suchan invitation.Three elves came and led her to a hollow mountain where the littlepeople lived. Everything there was small, but more ornate and splendidthan can be described. The new mother was lying in a bed of ebonydecorated with pearl buttons. The covers were embroidered with gold. Thecradle was made of ivory, and the bathtub of gold. The girl stood in asgodparent, and then wanted to go back home, but the elves asked herfervently to stay with them for three days. She agreed to do so, and thetime passed with pleasure and joy. The little people did everything tomake her happy.Finally she wanted to return home. They filled her pockets with goldand led her outside the mountain. She arrived home. Wanting to begin herwork, she picked up the broom that was still standing in the corner andstarted to sweep. Then some strange people came out of the house and askedher who she was and what she was doing there. It was not three days, asshe thought, that she had spent in the mountain with the little men, butrather seven years. In the meantime her former employers had died.
