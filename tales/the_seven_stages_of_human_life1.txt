Seven times in one verse did the author of Ecclesiastes make use of theword vanity , in allusion to the seven stages of human life.The first commences in the first year of human existence, when theinfant lies like a king on a soft couch, with numerous attendantsabout him, all ready to serve him, and eager to testify their love andattachment by kisses and embraces.The second commences about the age of two or three years, when thedarling child is permitted to crawl on the ground, and, like anunclean animal, delights in dirt and filth.Then at the age of ten, the thoughtless boy , without reflectingon the past or caring for the future, jumps and skips about like a youngkid on the enameled green, contented to enjoy the present moment.The fourth stage begins about the age of twenty, when the youngman , full of vanity and pride, begins to set off his person by dress.and, like a young unbroken horse, prances and gallops about in search of awife.Then comes the matrimonial state , when the poor man , likea patient ass, is obliged, however reluctantly, to toil and labor for aliving.Behold him now in the parental state , when surrounded byhelpless children craving his support and looking to him for bread. He isas bold, as vigilant, and as fawning, too, as the faithful dog. guardinghis little flock, and snatching at everything that comes in his way, inorder to provide for his offspring.At last comes the final stage, when the decrepit old man , likethe unwieldy though most sagacious elephant, becomes grave, sedate, anddistrustful. He then begins to hang down his head towards the ground, asif surveying the place where all his vast schemes must terminate, andwhere ambition and vanity are finally humbled to the dust.
