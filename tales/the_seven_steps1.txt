On the main road from Nenndorf to Hannover in the vicinity of thevillage of Eberloh, right next to the road, there can be seen sevenupright stones spaced like footsteps. They have been carefully preservedeven to this day. They are called the seven steps, and the followinglegend is associated with them:Many years ago two peasants came into conflict about the boundarybetween their adjoining fields. The one accused the other of plowing awaysome of his land. The accused man swore with an oath that he wasinnocent. Later the accuser wanted to prove that his neighbor hadperjured himself, and invited the court to see the fields for themselves.The person who had sworn the oath appeared as well, and said, "If Ihave sworn falsely then may God grant that I take no more than sevensteps." With his seventh step he disappeared, and was never seen again.
