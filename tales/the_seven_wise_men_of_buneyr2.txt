Seven men of Buneyr once left their native wilds for the purpose ofseeking their fortunes. When evening came they all sat down under a treeto rest, when one of them said, "Let us count to see if we are all here."So he counted, "One, two, three, four, five, six," but, quite omitting toreckon himself, he exclaimed, "There's one of us missing. We are onlysix!""Nonsense!" cried the others, andthe whole company of seven began counting with uplifted forefingers, butthey all forgot to count themselves.Fearing some evil, they now rose up, and at once set out to search fortheir missing comrade. Presently they met a shepherd, who greeted themcivilly and said, "Friends, why are you in such low spirits?""We have lost one of our party," answered they. "we started thismorning seven in number, and now we are only six. Have you seen any oneof us hereabouts?""But," said the shepherd, "seven you are, for I have found your lostcompanion. behold: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven! ""Ah," answered the wise men of Buneyr, "you have indeed found ourmissing brother. We owe you a debt of gratitude."
