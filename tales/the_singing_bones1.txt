Once upon a time there lived a man and a woman who had twenty fivechildren. They were very poor. The man was good, the woman was bad. Everyday when the husband returned from his work the wife served his dinner,but always meat without bones."How is it that this meat has no bones?""Because bones are heavy, and meat is cheaper without bones. They giveus more for the money."The husband ate, and said nothing."How is it you don't eat meat?""You forget that I have no teeth. How do you expect me to eat meatwithout teeth?""That is true," said the husband, and he said nothing more, because hewas afraid to grieve his wife, who was as wicked as she was ugly.When one has twenty five children one cannot think of them all thetime, and one does not see if one or two are missing. One day, after hisdinner, the husband asked for his children. When they were by him hecounted them, and found only fifteen. He asked his wife where were the tenothers. She answered that they were at their grandmother's, and every dayshe would send one more for them to get a change of air. That was true,every day there was one that was missing.One day the husband was at the threshold of his house, in front of alarge stone which was there. He was thinking of his children, and hewanted to go and get them at their grandmother's, when he heard voicesthat were saying:Our mother killed us,Our father ate us.We are not in a coffin,We are not in the cemetery.At first he did not understand what that meant, but he raised the stoneand saw a great quantity of bones, which began to sing again. He thenunderstood that it was the bones of his children, whom his wife hadkilled, and whom he had eaten. Then he was so angry that he killed hiswife, buried his children's bones in the cemetery, and stayed alone at hishouse.From that time he never ate meat, because he believed it would alwaysbe his children that he would eat.
