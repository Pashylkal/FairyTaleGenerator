Many years ago there lived in Trent an old master tailor whose wife hadinherited an unusual book from her mother. They say she had the sixth andthe seventh books of Moses. Whenever the woman read in the book, deer,wolves, hares, and other animals would come to her, lie down at her feet,and play with her children. All these animals would disappear as soon asthe book was closed.One day while the woman was reading the book, she was surprised by herhusband. He grabbed the book and threw it into the stove. But behold! Thefire went out, and the book remained undamaged. The tailor did not want tohave this book in his house any longer, so, acting on the advice of someold people, he had a boy who was born on a Sunday during the sermon throwthe book into the stove. That worked, for the book was immediatelyconsumed by the flames.
