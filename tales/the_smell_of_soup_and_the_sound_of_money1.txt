A beggar was given a piece of bread, but nothing to put on it. Hopingto get something to go with his bread, he went to a nearby inn and askedfor a handout. The innkeeper turned him away with nothing, but the beggarsneaked into the kitchen where he saw a large pot of soup cooking over thefire. He held his piece of bread over the steaming pot, hoping to thuscapture a bit of flavor from the good smelling vapor.Suddenly the innkeeper seized him by the arm and accused him ofstealing soup."I took no soup," said the beggar. "I was only smelling the vapor.""Then you must pay for the smell," answered the innkeeper.The poor beggar had no money, so the angry innkeeper dragged him beforethe qadi.Now Nasreddin Hodja was at that time serving as qadi, and he heard theinnkeeper's complaint and the beggar's explanation."So you demand payment for the smell of your soup?" summarized theHodja after the hearing."Yes!" insisted the innkeeper."Then I myself will pay you," said the Hodja, "and I will pay for thesmell of your soup with the sound of money."Thus saying, the Hodja drew two coins from his pocket, rang themtogether loudly, put them back into his pocket, and sent the beggar andthe innkeeper each on his own way.
