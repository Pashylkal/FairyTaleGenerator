The deer made fun of the snail because of his slowness, so the latterchallenged the former to a race. "We will race to the well on the otherside of the plaza," said the snail."All right," replied the deer.On the day of the race the deer ran swiftly to the well, and when he gotthere he called, "Mr. Snail, where are you?""Here I am," said the snail, sticking his head up out of the well.The deer was very much surprised, so he said, "I will race you to the nextwell.""Agreed," replied the snail.When the deer arrived at the next well, he called as before, "Mr. Snail,where are you?""Here I am," answered the snail. "Why have you been so slow? I have beenhere a long time waiting for you."The deer tried again and again, but always with the same result. until thedeer in disgust dashed his head against a tree and broke his neck.Now the first snail had not moved from his place, but he had many cousinsin each of the wells of the town and each exactly resembled the other.Having heard the crows talking of the proposed race, as they perched onthe edge of the wells to drink, they determined to help their cousin towin it, and so, as the deer came to each well, there was always a snailready to stick his head out and answer "Here I am" to the deer's inquiry.
