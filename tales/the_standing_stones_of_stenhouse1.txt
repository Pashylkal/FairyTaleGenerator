The most stately monument of this sort (circles of detached stones) inScotland, and probably inferior to none in England, excepting Stonehenge,is formed by what are called the Standing Stones of Stenhouse, in theisland of Pomona in the Orkneys, where it can scarcely be supposed thatDruids ever penetrated. At least, it is certain, that the common peoplenow consider it as a Scandinavian monument. and, according to an ancientcustom, a couple who are desirous to attach themselves by more than anordinary vow of fidelity, join hands through the round hole which is inone of the stones. This they call the promise of Odin.
