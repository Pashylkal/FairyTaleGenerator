John Roy, who lived in Glenbroun, in the parish of Abernethy, being outone night on the hills in search of his cattle, met a troop of fairies,who seemed to have got a prize of some sort or other. Recollecting thatthe fairies are obliged to exchange whatever they may have with any onewho offers them anything, however low in value, for it, he flung hisbonnet to them, crying Shuis slo slumus sheen ( i.e ., mine isyours and yours is mine). The fairies dropped their booty, which proved tobe a Sassenach (English) lady whom the dwellers of Shian of Coir laggachad carried away from her own country, leaving a stock in her place which,of course, died and was buried.John brought her home, and she lived for many years in his house."It happened, however, in the course of time," said the Gaelicnarrator, "that the new king found it necessary to make the greatroads through these countries by means of soldiers, for the purpose ofletting coaches and carriages pass to the northern cities. and thosesoldiers had officers and commanders in the same way as our fighting armyhave now. Those soldiers were never great favorites in these countries,particularly during the time that our kings were alive. and consequentlyit was no easy matter for them, either officers or men, to procure forthemselves comfortable quarters."But John Roy would not keep up the national animosity to the cottandearg (red coats), and he offered a residence in his house to aSaxon captain and his son. When there they could not take theireyes off the English lady, and the son remarked to his father what astrong likeness she bore to his deceased mother.The father replied that he too had been struck with the resemblance,and said he could almost fancy she was his wife. He then mentionedher name and those of some persons connected with them. The lady by thesewords at once recognized her husband and son, and honest John Roy had thesatisfaction of reuniting the long separated husband and wife, andreceiving their most grateful acknowledgments.
