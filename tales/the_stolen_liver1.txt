In the village of Hammer near Czernikowo many years ago there lived ayoung married couple. The wife loved to eat liver and could not live ifshe didn't eat a liver every day. One day she sent her husband once againto town to fetch a liver. However, in Czernikowo the husband met a groupof young merrymakers and went with them to a tavern, where he drank awayall his money.Sad, and without the liver, he made his way homeward. It was late. Onhis way he had to go through a great forest. Here he met a hunter, whoasked him why he was so sad. The man told him everything, upon which thehunter said, "In the middle of the forest there is a clearing with agallows, upon which a number of dead bodies are hanging. Take one of themdown, cut out his liver, and give it to your wife. Tell her it is beefliver."The man did just that.When he arrived home his wife was at first angry because he had beenaway so long, but she calmed down as soon as she saw the liver, and beganfrying it. The man lay down and went to sleep.Suddenly a white figure appeared at the window, and it cried into theroom, "Everyone is asleep. The dogs are keeping watch in the yard. And youare standing there frying my liver."The man was terrified, and in his fear he cried out to his wife thatshe should come to bed. But the wife wanted first to dip a little piece ofbread into the gravy and taste it.Meanwhile, the phantom, a white skeleton, had already entered thehouse, always calling out the same words again and again.The woman was not afraid, but asked the ghost, "Now, my little fellow,what happened to your flesh?"The ghost replied, "The ravens ate it, and the wind blew it away."Then the woman asked, "Now, my little fellow, what happened to youreyes and ears?"And the ghost answered, "The ravens ate them, and the wind blew themaway."The woman asked, "Now, my little fellow, what happened to yourliver?"Then the ghost cried out, "You have it!" And with that he seized thewoman and strangled her to death.
