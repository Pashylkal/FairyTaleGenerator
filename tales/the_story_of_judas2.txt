You must know that Judas was the one who betrayed Jesus Christ.Now when Judas betrayed him, his Master said: "Repent, Judas, for Ipardon you."But Judas, not at all! He departed with his bag of money, in despairand cursing heaven and earth. What did he do? While he was going alongthus desperate he came across a tamarind tree. (You must know that thetamarind was formerly a large tree, like the olive and walnut.) When hesaw this tamarind a wild thought entered his mind, remembering the treasonhe had committed. He made a noose in a rope and hung himself to thetamarind. And hence it is (because this traitor Judas was cursed by God)that the tamarind tree dried up, and from that time on it ceased growingup into a tree and became a short, twisted, and tangled bush. and its woodis good for nothing, neither to burn, nor to make anything out of, and allon account of Judas, who hanged himself on it.Some say that the soul of Judas went to the lowest hell, to suffer themost painful torments. but I have heard, from older persons who can know,that Judas's soul has a severer sentence. They say that it is in the air,always wandering about the world, without being able to rise higher orfall lower. and every day, on all the tamarind shrubs that it meets, itsees its body hanging and torn by the dogs and birds of prey. They saythat the pain he suffers cannot be told, and that it makes the flesh creepto think of it. And thus Jesus Christ condemned him for his greattreason.
