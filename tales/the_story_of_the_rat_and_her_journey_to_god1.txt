In a mill a rat once lived and prospered. It took after the miller, andfrom day to day its paunch grew bigger. It became asround as a cucumber and as fat as a candle.One day, looking at its round, sleek figure, the rat said to itself,"Behold I am so beautiful and strong. Why should I not goand pay a visit to God? He is sure to receive me."No sooner said than done. Leaving the mill, he started on his journeyto God. After traveling a few days and not comingnearer to God, he stopped and said, "Methinks that either God lives muchfarther away than I believed, or I have lost my way. Iwill go to the sun and ask where God is."Coming to the sun, the rat asked, "Where is God?""Off with you," shouted the sun. "I have no time for idle talkers."The rat went to the clouds and asked them, "Where is God?""We cannot stop to bandy words with the like of you."Away the rat went and came to the wind. "Where is God?" asked the rat."There," replied the wind, whistling, and getting hold of the rathurled him down onto an ant heap, and there he found hislevel.
