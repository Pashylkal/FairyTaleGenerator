Down in the south, where the sun shines so hotly that everything andeverybody sleeps all day, and even the great forests seem silent, exceptearly in the morning and late in the evening down in this country thereonce lived a young man and a maiden. The girl had been born in the town,and had scarcely ever left it. but the young man was a native of anothercountry, and had only come to the city near the great river because hecould find no work to do where he was.A few months after his arrival, when the days were cooler, and thepeople did not sleep so much as usual, a great feast was held a littleway out of the town, and to this feast everyone flocked from thirtymiles and more. Some walked and some rode, some came in beautiful goldencoaches. but all had on splendid dresses of red or blue, while wreathsof flowers rested on their hair.It was the first time that the youth had been present on such anoccasion, and he stood silently aside watching the graceful dancesand the pretty games played by the young people. And as he watched,he noticed one girl, dressed in white with scarlet pomegranates in herhair, who seemed to him lovelier than all the rest.When the feast was over, and the young man returned home, his manner wasso strange that it drew the attention of all his friends.Through his work next day the youth continued to see the girl's face,throwing the ball to her companions, or threading her way between themas she danced. At night sleep fled from him, and after tossing forhours on his bed, he would get up and plunge into a deep pool that lay alittle way in the forest.This state of things went on for some weeks, then at last chancefavoured him. One evening, as he was passing near the house where shelived, he saw her standing with her back to the wall, trying to beat offwith her fan the attacks of a savage dog that was leaping at her throat.Alonzo, for such was his name, sprang forward, and with one blow ofhis fist stretched the creature dead upon the road. He then helped thefrightened and half fainting girl into the large cool verandah where herparents were sitting, and from that hour he was a welcome guest in thehouse, and it was not long before he was the promised husband of Julia.Every day, when his work was done, he used to go up to the house,half hidden among flowering plants and brilliant creepers, wherehumming birds darted from bush to bush, and parrots of all colours, redand green and grey, shrieked in chorus. There he would find the maidenwaiting for him, and they would spend an hour or two under the stars,which looked so large and bright that you felt as if you could almosttouch them.'What did you do last night after you went home?' suddenly asked thegirl one evening.'Just the same as I always do,' answered he. 'It was too hot to sleep,so it was no use going to bed, and I walked straight of to the forestand bathed in one of those deep dark pools at the edge of the river. Ihave been there constantly for several months, but last night a strangething happened. I was taking my last plunge, when I heard sometimesfrom one side, and sometimes from another the sound of a voice singingmore sweetly than any nightingale, though I could not catch any words. Ileft the pool, and, dressing myself as fast as I could, I searchedevery bush and tree round the water, as I fancied that perhaps it was myfriend who was playing a trick on me, but there was not a creature to beseen. and when I reached home I found my friend fast asleep.'As Julia listened her face grew deadly white, and her whole bodyshivered as if with cold. From her childhood she had heard stories ofthe terrible beings that lived in the forests and were hidden underthe banks of the rivers, and could only be kept off by powerful charms.Could the voice which had bewitched Alonzo have come from one of these?Perhaps, who knows, it might be the voice of the dreaded Yara herself,who sought young men on the eve of their marriage as her prey.For a moment the girl sat choked with fear, as these thoughts rushedthrough her. then she said: 'Alonzo, will you promise something?''What is that?' asked he.'It is something that has to do with our future happiness.''Oh! it is serious, then? Well, of course I promise. Now tell me!''I want you to promise,' she answered, lowering her voice to a whisper,'never to bathe in those pools again.''But why not, queen of my soul. have I not gone there always, andnothing has harmed me, flower of my heart?''No. but perhaps something will. If you will not promise I shall go madwith fright. Promise me.''Why, what is the matter? You look so pale! Tell me why you are sofrightened?''Did you not hear the song?' she asked, trembling.'Suppose I did, how could that hurt me? It was the loveliest song I everheard!''Yes, and after the song will come the apparition. and after that after that ''I don't understand. Well after that?''After that death.'Alonzo stared at her. Had she really gone mad? Such talk was very unlikeJulia. but before he could collect his senses the girl spoke again:'That is the reason why I implore you never to go there again. at anyrate till after we are married.''And what difference will our marriage make?''Oh, there will be no danger then. you can go to bathe as often as youlike!''But tell me why you are so afraid?''Because the voice you heard I know you will laugh, but it is quitetrue it was the voice of the Yara.'At these words Alonzo burst into a shout of laughter. but it soundedso harsh and loud that Julia shrank away shuddering. It seemed as if hecould not stop himself, and the more he laughed the paler the poor girlbecame, murmuring to herself as she watched him:'Oh, heaven! you have seen her! you have seen her! what shall I do?'Faint as was her whisper, it reached the ears of Alonzo, who, though hestill could not speak for laughing, shook his head.'You may not know it, but it is true. Nobody who has not seen theYara laughs like that.' And Julia flung herself on the ground weepingbitterly.At this sight Alonzo became suddenly grave, and kneeling by her side,gently raised her up.'Do not cry so, my angel,' he said, 'I will promise anything you please.Only let me see you smile again.'With a great effort Julia checked her sobs, and rose to her feet.'Thank you,' she answered. 'My heart grows lighter as you say that! Iknow you will try to keep your word and to stay away from the forest.But the power of the Yara is very strong, and the sound of her voice isapt to make men forget everything else in the world. Oh, I have seen it,and more than one betrothed maiden lives alone, broken hearted. If everyou should return to the pool where you first heard the voice, promiseme that you will at least take this with you.' And opening a curiouslycarved box, she took out a sea shell shot with many colours, and sang asong softly into it. 'The moment you hear the Yara's voice,' said she,'put this to your ear, and you will hear my song instead. Perhaps I donot know for certain but perhaps, I may be stronger than the Yara.'It was late that night when Alonzo returned home. The moon was shiningon the distant river, which looked cool and inviting, and the trees ofthe forest seemed to stretch out their arms and beckon him near. But theyoung man steadily turned his face in the other direction, and went hometo bed.The struggle had been hard, but Alonzo had his reward next day in thejoy and relief with which Julia greeted him. He assured her that havingovercome the temptation once the danger was now over. but she, knowingbetter than he did the magic of the Yara's face and voice, did not failto make him repeat his promise when he went away.For three nights Alonzo kept his word, not because he believed in theYara, for he thought that the tales about her were all nonsense, butbecause he could not bear the tears with which he knew that Julia wouldgreet him, if he confessed that he had returned to the forest. But, inspite of this, the song rang in his ears, and daily grew louder.On the fourth night the attraction of the forest grew so strong thatneither the thought of Julia nor the promises he had made her could holdhim back. At eleven o'clock he plunged into the cool darkness of thetrees, and took the path that led straight to the river. Yet, for thefirst time, he found that Julia's warnings, though he had laughed at herat the moment, had remained in his memory, and he glanced at the busheswith a certain sense of fear which was quite new to him.When he reached the river he paused and looked round for a moment tomake sure that the strange feeling of some one watching him was fancy,and he was really alone. But the moon shone brightly on every tree, andnothing was to be seen but his own shadow. nothing was to be heard butthe sound of the rippling stream.He threw off his clothes, and was just about to dive in headlong, whensomething he did not know what suddenly caused him to look round. Atthe same instant the moon passed from behind a cloud, and its rays fellon a beautiful golden haired woman standing half hidden by the ferns.With one bound he caught up his mantle, and rushed headlong down thepath he had come, fearing at each step to feel a hand laid on hisshoulder. It was not till he had left the last trees behind him, andwas standing in the open plain, that he dared to look round, and thenhe thought a figure in white was still standing there waving her armsto and fro. This was enough. he ran along the road harder than ever, andnever paused till he was save in his own room.With the earliest rays of dawn he went back to the forest to see whetherhe could find any traces of the Yara, but though he searched every clumpof bushes, and looked up every tree, everything was empty, and the onlyvoices he heard were those of parrots, which are so ugly that they onlydrive people away.'I think I must be mad,' he said to himself, 'and have dreamt all thatfolly'. and going back to the city he began his daily work. But eitherthat was harder than usual, or he must be ill, for he could not fix hismind upon it, and everybody he came across during the day inquired ifanything had happened to give him that white, frightened look.'I must be feverish,' he said to himself. 'after all, it is ratherdangerous to take a cold bath when one is feeling so hot.' Yet he knew,while he said it, that he was counting the hours for night to come, thathe might return to the forest.In the evening he went as usual to the creeper covered house. But hehad better have stayed away, as his face was so pale and his manner sostrange, that the poor girl saw that something terrible had occurred.Alonzo, however, refused to answer any of her questions, and all shecould get was a promise to hear everything the next day.On pretence of a violent headache, he left Julia much earlier than usualand hurried quickly home. Taking down a pistol, he loaded it and put itin his belt, and a little before midnight he stole out on the tips ofhis toes, so as to disturb nobody. Once outside he hastened down theroad which led to the forest.He did not stop till he had reached the river pool, when holding thepistol in his hand, he looked about him. At every little noise thefalling of a leaf, the rustle of an animal in the bushes, the cry of anight bird he sprang up and cocked his pistol in the direction of thesound. But though the moon still shone he saw nothing, and by and bya kind of dreamy state seemed to steal over him as he leant against atree.How long he remained in this condition he could not have told, butsuddenly he awoke with a start, on hearing his name uttered softly.'Who is that?' he cried, standing upright instantly. but only an echoanswered him. Then his eyes grew fascinated with the dark waters of thepool close to his feet, and he looked at it as if he could never lookaway.He gazed steadily into the depths for some minutes, when he became awarethat down in the darkness was a bright spark, which got rapidly biggerand brighter. Again that feeling of awful fear took possession ofhim, and he tried to turn his eyes from the pool. But it was no use.something stronger than himself compelled him to keep them there.At last the waters parted softly, and floating on the surface he sawthe beautiful woman whom he had fled from only a few nights before. Heturned to run, but his feet were glued to the spot.She smiled at him and held out her arms, but as she did so there cameover him the remembrance of Julia, as he had seen her a few hoursearlier, and her warnings and fears for the very danger in which he nowfound himself.Meanwhile the figure was always drawing nearer, nearer. but, with aviolent effort, Alonzo shook off his stupor, and taking aim at hershoulder he pulled the trigger. The report awoke the sleeping echoes,and was repeated all through the forest, but the figure smiled still,and went on advancing. Again Alonzo fired, and a second time the bulletwhistled through the air, and the figure advanced nearer. A moment more,and she would be at his side.Then, his pistol being empty, he grasped the barrel with both hands, andstood ready to use it as a club should the Yara approach and closer. Butnow it seemed her turn to feel afraid, for she paused an instant whilehe pressed forward, still holding the pistol above his head, prepared tostrike.In his excitement he had forgotten the river, and it was not till thecold water touched his feet that he stood still by instinct. The Yarasaw that he was wavering, and suffering herself to sway gently backwardsand forwards on the surface of the river, she began to sing. The songfloated through the trees, now far and now near. no one could tellwhence it came, the whole air seemed full of it. Alonzo felt his sensesgoing and his will failing. His arms dropped heavily to his side, but infalling struck against the sea shell, which, as he had promised Julia,he had always carried in his coat.His dimmed mind was just clear enough to remember what she had said, andwith trembling fingers, that were almost powerless to grasp, he drew itout. As he did so the song grew sweeter and more tender than before,but he shut his ears to it and bent his head over the shell. Out of itsdepths arose the voice of Julia singing to him as she had sung when shegave him the shell, and though the notes sounded faint at first, theyswelled louder and louder till the mist which had gathered about him wasblown away.Then he raised his head, feeling that he had been through strangeplaces, where he could never wander any more. and he held himself erectand strong, and looked about him. Nothing was to be seen but the shiningof the river, and the dark shadows of the trees. nothing was to be heardbut the hum of the insects, as they darted through the night.
