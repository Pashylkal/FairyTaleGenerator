In a certain city there are a Gamarala, a Gama gaeni (his wife), and a sonof theirs. The Gamarala went to the Chena. The Gama gaeni lay down andtold the Gama puta (the son) to examine her head (for insects). While hewas looking through the hair she fell asleep, and a fly settled on herhead. "Ade! Fly, do not bite our mother's head," he said. "Mother willscold me."The fly having gone flying away, settled again on her head. Saying ,"Nowthen, this fly is biting mother's head again," he placed his mother's headgently on the ground. Then having gone and taken a rice pestle, and comeback with it, he said, "Is the fly still biting the head?" and struck atthe fly with the rice pestle, killing his mother with the blow.The boy's father having come, tried to arouse her. "How is it that motheris dead?" he asked.The boy said, "A fly was biting our mother's head. I struck it with therice pestle. Because of it she died."So the Gamarala took the woman away and buried her.
