The swan is said to sing but once in its life   when it knows that it isabout to die. A certain man who had heard ofthe song of the swan one day saw one of these birds for sale in themarket, and bought it and took it home with him. Afew days later he had some friends to dinner, and produced the swan, andbade it sing for their entertainment. but theswan remained silent. In course of time, when it was growing old, itbecame aware of its approaching end and brokeinto a sweet, sad song. When its owner heard it, he said angrily, "If thecreature only sings when it is about to die,what a fool I was that day I wanted to hear its song! I ought to havewrung its neck instead of merely inviting it tosing."
