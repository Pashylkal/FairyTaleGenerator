Three goats went into a grove to eat leaves. The first had one littlebelly, the second had two little bellies, and the third had three littlebellies.The one with one little belly was soon full and was the first to go home.But a wolf laid himself across the narrow mountain path and said, "Run!Run, or I'll eat you up!"The goat said, "Don't eat me up. I am very skinny, but a goat will sooncome who has two little bellies. He will fill you up." And the wolf lethim go.Then came the second goat, the one with two little bellies, and who wasnow full. The wolf said to him as well, "Run! Run, or I'll eat you up!"He said, "Don't eat me up. I am only half meat, but a goat will soon comewho has three little bellies, and who will fill you up completely." Andthe wolf let him go as well.Then came the third goat, the one with three little bellies. He hadfinally gotten full.The wolf said to him, "Run! Run, or I'll eat you up!"This goat said nothing in return, but instead, brave and forward as hewas, lowered his horns and gave the wolf such a blow that he fell from thecliff into the chasm below and broke his right leg. And there the poorrascal lay. He wanted the biggest and fattest mouthfull, but instead gotnothing   but pain.
