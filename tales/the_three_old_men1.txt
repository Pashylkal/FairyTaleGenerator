There are people still living today in the Duchy of Schleswig, in theregion of the Angles, who remember the following story. They heard it fromthe mouth of Pastor Oest, who died some time ago and who is known forseveral scholarly works. However, it is not known if he himselfexperienced the events, or if it was a neighboring preacher.In the middle of the eighteenth century it happened that a new preacherwas riding around the boundaries of his diocese in order to familiarizehimself thoroughly with its circumstances. In a remote area there was alonely farmstead, and the road led directly past the front yard of thefarmhouse. An old man with snow white hair was sitting there on a benchand crying bitterly. The pastor wished him a good evening and asked himwhat was wrong with him."Oh," answered the old man, "my father gave me a beating."Surprised, the preacher tied up his horse and entered the house. He wasmet in the entryway by an old man even more aged than the first one. Hewas openly agitated and making angry gestures. The preacher addressed himkindly and asked him the cause of his anger.The old man spoke, "Oh, the boy dropped my father!"With that he opened the parlor door. The pastor was struck with silenceand astonishment when he saw there an old man, bent over with age butstill energetic, sitting in an easy chair next to the stove.
