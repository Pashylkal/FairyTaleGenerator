There was a saltlick in the jungle to which all the beasts of theforest resorted, but they were greatly afraid by reason of anold tiger which killed one of them every day. At length, therefore, Plandothe mouse deer said to the tiger, "Why not permit meto bring you a beast every day, to save you from hunting for your food?"The tiger consented, and Plando went off to make arrangement with thebeasts. But he could not persuade any of them togo, and after three days he set off, taking nobody with him but Kuwis thesmallest of the flying squirrels.On their arrival Plando said to the tiger, "I could not bring you anyof the other beasts because the way was blocked by afat old tiger with a flying squirrel sitting astride its muzzle."On hearing this the tiger exclaimed, "Let us go and find it and driveit away."The three therefore set out, the flying squirrel perched upon thetiger's muzzle and the mouse deer sitting astride upon itshind quarters.On reaching the river, the mouse deer pointed to the tiger's likenessin the water and exclaimed, "Look there! That is the fatold tiger that I saw."On hearing this, the tiger sprang into the river to attack his ownshadow (reflection), and was drowned immediately.
