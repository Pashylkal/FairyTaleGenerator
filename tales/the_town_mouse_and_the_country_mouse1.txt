Now you must know that a town mouse once upon a time went on a visit tohis cousin in the country. He was rough and ready, this cousin, but heloved his town friend and made him heartily welcome. Beans and bacon,cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely.The town mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, andsaid, "I cannot understand, cousin, how you can put up with such poorfood as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in thecountry. come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you havebeen in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood acountry life." No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for thetown and arrived at the town mouse's residence late at night."You will want some refreshment after our long journey," said the politetown mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining room. There theyfound the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating upjellies and cakes and all that was nice. Suddenly they heard growlingand barking."What is that?" said the country mouse."It is only the dogs of the house," answered the other."Only!" said the country mouse." I do not like that music at mydinner." Just at that moment the door flew open, in came two hugemastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and run off." Good bye,cousin," said the country mouse."What! Going so soon?" said the other."Yes," he replied. "Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and alein fear."
