THE TRAVELLING SCHOLAR FROM PARADISE(October 8, 1550)THE PERSONS.The Travelling Scholar.The Farmer.The Farmer's Wife.WifeMy breath is burdened with my sighs,While thoughts of bygone days ariseWhen my first husband lived.Ah me, He loved me dearly, tenderly.As I loved him! He was most kind.Honest in thought, and calm in mind:With him the gladness of my lifeDied out though I became a wifeAgain, and try, through weary days,To love my man. Alas, alwaysRemembrance comes to mar my plan!He is not like my first good man:This one is parsimonious, stern.Anxious more money still to earn.He would be rich. for mirth cares not  Alas, how weary is my lot.Thinking of him now lost to me!Would I could show my memoryTo him, who made me laugh and sing!Oh, I would give him everything!(The Travelling Scholar comes.)ScholarDear mother, pray may I come in?I would thy commendation win.Thy charitable hand and alms.I have much skill and many charmsFrom books, and Venus' mountain know.Where I have Cupids seen, and soCan tell of marvels. Now I goThroughout the land, and to and fro.A traveller upon my wayFrom Paris, here I may not stay  WifeDear sir! Dear sir! What dost thou say?From Paradise thou cam'st? I pray,Dear sir, thou wilt to me declareIf thou didst see my husband there?He died   O God, why was it so  To my sore grief, a year ago.He was so honest, gentle, wise,I hope that he found Paradise.ScholarThere were so many fair souls there!  Tell me, what garments did he wearWhen he passed to eternity?And this may stir my memory.WifeEasy it is to tell thee this  I hope that he is now in bliss!  He wore a blue hat, and his dressA winding sheet, no more, nor less:The winding sheet was not so bad.I wish he had been better clad.ScholarOh, my good dame, yes: that blue hat!How well do I remember that!No trowsers, shirt, nor shoes, he had.Just in his grave cloth. it was sad:Howe'er he might that blue hat cock.And wrap his sheet, it was a mock.When others ate he could not join  He had no heller, not a coin  He looked at them with longing face.And lingered much about the place.Unless an alms some good soul givesThe Lord alone knows how he lives!Good dame, it grieves me much to sayHe is in such a wretched wav.WifeDear husband! What hard fate he hath.Not e'en a pfennig for a bath!How pitiful! What grief to meHe in such poverty should be!Tell me, dear sir, more thanks to earn,Dost thou to Paradise return?ScholarTomorrow I set forth, and fareFor fourteen days, to bring me there.WifeWilt thou a bundle from me bear,For my dear husband, with all care?ScholarGladly will I. but do not wasteMy time. I am in utmost haste.WifeDear sir, have patience: I will beBut a short time while hurriedlyI gather up such things as heMay use in his necessity.(The Wife goes out.)ScholarShe is a simple soul, and kind  Too good to cheat   but I must findMoney and clothing, which I need.Then I will go away with speedBefore her husband comes. for heMay lack his wife's simplicity.So would he spoil the thing for me.Therefore I go while yet I canBecome the heir of this dead man.(The Wife brings in a bundle.)WifeGood messenger, I beg of thee,Take these twelve gulden now from me  This money so long hid away,My little all, for a dark day  Take it, dear sir, to him, I pray.With this my hoard I gladly partTo the true husband of my heart.The bundle, too, I pray thee, takeTo my dear husband for his sake:Therein are blue cloth, hose and shoes.The cloth he surely there can useFor coat and trowsers: and, with these,Pocket and pocket knife will please.Tell him, the next time I will tryTo send him a more full supply.For I will save up all I can.Thinking of him, my dear, good man.Now go at once, that sooner heMay be relieved from poverty.(The Travelling Scholar takes up the bundle.)ScholarHow will thy husband gaily think.When, on a feast day, he will drinkWith friends his quart, how dear is sheWho sends this cheer and revelry!WifeHow long, dear messenger, I pray,Will be the time thou art away?ScholarIt may be long: it cannot beThat I shall come quite speedily.WifeAlas! if very long awayHis money will be spent: no play,Nor food, nor drink, nor bath! Alas,That this too soon may come to pass!This groschen is my last. take it.I have no more of coin, nor wit.When threshing time is o'er I canSteal some odd coins from my good man,And bury them, as once before.Just at inside of stable door.There they are safe   my gulden fairI kept for months in safety there  Accept this thaler for thy pay:Say greetings to my good man, pray!(The Travelling Scholar goes out.)Wife (singing)Peasant maiden, Love is bright.He may come to thee, tonight.Peasant maiden. Love is sweet.He may kneel before thy feet.Peasant wife, put Love away.He cares not for thee today.FarmerDame, thou art merry: pray thee tellWhat is it pleaseth thee so well?WifeDear husband, O rejoice with me!I tell my happiness to thee:FarmerWho hit this fool calf in the eye?(A common inquiry among the peasantry, in the time of this drama, when one appeared unaccountably excited.)WifeIt is a marvel! Passing by,A scholar stopped and spoke with me:From Paradise quite recentlyHe wandered hither. and he toldOf my first husband, poor and old:He only has his old blue hatAnd winding sheet. Oh, think of that!He hath no money, coat, nor shoes.No hose, nor anything to useSave hat and sheet   no, nothing saveWhat he took with him to the grave.FarmerWilt thou not send him something fit?WifeDear husband, yes. I thought of it:I sent our blue cloth, shirt and hose,And breeches. He doth need the clothes.I sent a gulden, too, that heMight not without a groschen be.FarmerThou hast done well. But which way wentThe man by whom thy gifts were sent?WifeHe went by the Low Road, and boreThe bundle on his back. He woreAround his neck a yellow net.FarmerYes, wife. and I will find him yet.Thou hast done well to give the stuff.But, of the money, not enough  Not near enough. it will not last.Have my horse saddled to go fast.And I will ride the Low Road o'er.And give the man ten gulden more.WifeBefore all things do I thank thee.That thou art now so good to meAnd my old husband. TenderlyI will deserve this love. IndeedAll of my savings, in thy need, I'll give  FarmerCease babbling now to me!Have my horse saddled instantly,Or, in the fen land, he will beForever lost to me and thee.(The Wife goes out.)FarmerAch Gott, how weak a wife have I!That she is fair none will deny.She cooks a sausage, cleans a dish,But, in her mind, is a stock fish:Half fool! yes. more a fool than anyFools of our parish, who are many.She sends her husband, dead a year,Money and clothes, and hath no fearThe scholar hath deceived her. Ah!To catch the rogue will I ride far.Then I will beat the rascal well,So each big bruise will surely tellThat Paradise he hath not found.Then, while he grovels on the ground,Money and clothes will I retake,And bear them home. For safety's sakeMy wife must feel my fists. if sheHave black eyes, to remember meAnd her own folly, it may beA lesson. Through her foolishnessMy fortune must grow less and less.Alas, that I, to please my eyes,Married this useless, comely prize!I shall repent me all my days:If she had shrewd though drunken ways,So were she better, and might beMore of a helpmate unto me.(The Wife comes in.)WifeThe horse is ready: mount! away!And God go with thee through the day!(The Farmer and his Wife go out . the Travelling Scholar comes in with his pack.)ScholarHow Fortune bids my star arise!Puts in my hand unlooked for prize!Now I can live the winter through  And there are other women, too.Foolish as this, who will as wellBelieve each tale that I may tell  Others, like this, not over wise.Who will send me to Paradise  Odd bobs! Here comes one riding fast.Behind the hedge my pack I cast.I doubt not this good man would takeBundle and coin for his wife's sake.He may not promptly be deceived.Nor his wife's Paradise believed.He cannot ride across the moor.The fen land swamp would bog him sore  Ah! he dismounts. I put awayMy net. and wait what he may say.Leaning on my poor stick, who canSuspect I am no peasant man?(The Farmer comes in with spurs on.)FarmerGood luck, my man! In this wild wasteHast seen one running in hot haste,With yellow neck net? On his backA bundle blue, Uke peddler's pack ?ScholarOh, yes . I saw him passing here.He crossed the moor like hunted deer.Across the moor, and to the wood.A moment, resting there, he stood.Through these scrub bushes went his track.He had a bundle on his back.Weary he seemed as on he ran.You quickly may o'ertake the man.FarmerUpon my oath, it must be he!Good fellow, hold my horse for me.Through this soft moss I needs must run.To catch this crafty, thievish one.Then will I beat him black and blue  A beating that he long shall rue.If he live long, which much I doubt.Hold fast the horse till I come out.ScholarI wait a priest, and so shall stayUntil he soon may pass this way.I gladly hold your horse's reinIf you will soon be back again.FarmerEarn thus a kreuzer. I am strong:Catching this thief will not take long.ScholarGo swiftly on, the moor across.And have no fear about your horse.(The Farmer goes out)Welcome is this fine horse to me:Fair Fortune smiles most graciously.And brings good luck still in my way.This is, indeed, my lucky day!The simple wife gave clothes and gold.Her husband gives his horse   to hold.Which I will do: I need not walk.The man is kind, for all his talk:He sees I am a lazy man.And so he helps me all he can.The bog is dangerous and deep,And the safe pathway hard to keep.Unless he choose his footsteps niceHe will be first in Paradise.For should he here a misstep makeIt were the last that he would take.Now I will strap my pack acrossThe back of this convenient horse.I care not here to make long stay.But speedily will ride away.This husband will have searched in vain,And soon, perchance, be back again.He might be in such surly mood.My acts would be misunderstood.So, laden with my good supplies,I spur away to Paradise.While he still seeks his horse to win,I eat my roast fowl at an inn.(The Travelling Student rides off with his pack. The Wife comes in.)WifeIt is a lonesome time today!Oh wherefore doth my husband stay!I fear that he has lost his wayIn bogs, so my old husband maySuffer in want from long delay  I hear the evening pipe's loud blast.And home the pigs are running fast.(The Wife goes out, and the Farmer comes in and looks around.)FarmerOdds bobs! Where is my horse? Not here?What a wise man am I! 'Tis clear:The rascal that deceived my wifeHas now my horse. Upon my life,He has our money, clothes and horse,And I am left with triple loss!To trust that lying rogue, am IThe biggest fool beneath the sky!Here comes my wife, and looks for me.I dare not tell this history:I threatened her with beating sore.Now I deserve that beating more.She lost the clothes   small loss indeed  But I have lost my good grey steed.She to no stratagems was schooled.While I suspected, yet was fooled.When I have thought a fool was she,I wise, it seems two fools are we.(The Wife comes in.)WifeOn foot? Then thy good horse is sold.Found'st thou the man? and gav'st the gold?FarmerHe said the way was very long,And he was weary, and not strong:So I gave up my horse that heIn Paradise might sooner be:Thus will thy husband have our helpAnd my good horse to ride, himself.Say, wife, have I in this done right?I sought to help thy man's sad plight.WifeIndeed thou hast. My husband, dear,I have not rightly known, I fear.Thy faithful heart. I do not jest:If thou wert dead, indeed my bestI then would do to send to theeIn Paradise, that thou might'st beContented there: I would resignGoose, calf and pig, clothes, all our coin,Whatever useful thing was mine.That thou should'st know my faithful heart.How with my treasures I would part,That thus thou mightest have the best,Happy in Paradise to rest.FarmerI trust that here I long may stay.Nor need such help. but, wife, I pray.Of what has happened, nothing say.WifeThrough all the village it is known.FarmerWho hath the news so quickly sown?WifeWhen thou wert gone, most gratefullyI told our friends how good to meThou art, of Paradise, and howMy dear old husband is there now.How, by a messenger most wise,I sent him things to Paradise.It seemed that people laughed at me,And took the matter merrily.FarmerThe Devil take their pleasantry,That dares to make a scoff of thee!  Scoff of my wife! Dear God, I prayFor patience!   Hasten, wife, away,And bring a bowl of milk to me.WifeYes, husband. follow presently.(The Wife goes out.)FarmerWhy do I thus complain? My fateHath given me a fool for mate.But yet a faithful fool. 'Tis trueThat lack of sense is nothing new.But she is silly past belief,And, for this fault, is no relief:I constantly must hold her rein.And her simplicity restrain.Must bear with her, for e'en todayMy foot from stirrup slipped away:Who doth the shuttlecock let fallShould not another clumsy call.Better it is I proved a fool,So cannot make a cruel rule,For, in her heart, she is so kind,My own to softness is inclined.Who falls a victim to deceitShould not find fault when others meetThe like misfortune. but forgive,That all in peacefulness may live:Kind charity for faulty actsRedeems our own, remarks Hans Sachs.
