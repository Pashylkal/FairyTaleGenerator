YOU know the tale of poor Little Red Riding hood, that the Wolf deceivedand devoured, with her cake, her little butter can, and her Grandmother.well, the true story happened quite differently, as we know now. Andfirst of all the little girl was called and is still called LittleGolden hood. secondly, it was not she, nor the good grand dame, but thewicked Wolf who was, in the end, caught and devoured.Only listen.The story begins something like the tale.There was once a little peasant girl, pretty and nice as a star in itsseason. Her real name was Blanchette, but she was more often calledLittle Golden hood, on account of a wonderful little cloak with a hood,gold  and fire coloured, which she always had on. This little hood wasgiven her by her Grandmother, who was so old that she did not knowher age. it ought to bring her good luck, for it was made of a ray ofsunshine, she said. And as the good old woman was considered somethingof a witch, everyone thought the little hood rather bewitched too.And so it was, as you will see.One day the mother said to the child: 'Let us see, my littleGolden hood, if you know now how to find your way by yourself. You shalltake this good piece of cake to your Grandmother for a Sunday treatto morrow. You will ask her how she is, and come back at once, withoutstopping to chatter on the way with people you don't know. Do you quiteunderstand?''I quite understand,' replied Blanchette gaily. And off she went withthe cake, quite proud of her errand.But the Grandmother lived in another village, and there was a big woodto cross before getting there. At a turn of the road under the trees,suddenly 'Who goes there?''Friend Wolf.'He had seen the child start alone, and the villain was waiting to devourher. when at the same moment he perceived some wood cutters who mightobserve him, and he changed his mind. Instead of falling upon Blanchettehe came frisking up to her like a good dog.''Tis you! my nice Little Golden hood,' said he. So the little girlstops to talk with the Wolf, who, for all that, she did not know in theleast.'You know me, then!' said she. 'what is your name?''My name is friend Wolf. And where are you going thus, my pretty one,with your little basket on your arm?''I am going to my Grandmother, to take her a good piece of cake for herSunday treat to morrow.''And where does she live, your Grandmother?''She lives at the other side of the wood, in the first house in thevillage, near the windmill, you know.''Ah! yes! I know now,' said the Wolf. 'Well, that's just where I'mgoing. I shall get there before you, no doubt, with your little bits oflegs, and I'll tell her you're coming to see her. then she'll wait foryou.'Thereupon the Wolf cuts across the wood, and in five minutes arrives atthe Grandmother's house.He knocks at the door: toc, toc.No answer.He knocks louder.Nobody.Then he stands up on end, puts his two fore paws on the latch and thedoor opens.Not a soul in the house.The old woman had risen early to sell herbs in the town, and she hadgone off in such haste that she had left her bed unmade, with her greatnight cap on the pillow.'Good!' said the Wolf to himself, 'I know what I'll do.'He shuts the door, pulls on the Grandmother's night cap down tohis eyes, then he lies down all his length in the bed and draws thecurtains.In the meantime the good Blanchette went quietly on her way, as littlegirls do, amusing herself here and there by picking Easter daisies,watching the little birds making their nests, and running after thebutterflies which fluttered in the sunshine.At last she arrives at the door.Knock, knock.'Who is there?' says the Wolf, softening his rough voice as best he can.'It's me, Granny, your little Golden hood. I'm bringing you a big pieceof cake for your Sunday treat to morrow.''Press your finger on the latch, then push and the door opens.''Why, you've got a cold, Granny,' said she, coming in.'Ahem! a little, a little...' replies the Wolf, pretending to cough.'Shut the door well, my little lamb. Put your basket on the table, andthen take off your frock and come and lie down by me: you shall rest alittle.'The good child undresses, but observe this! She kept her little hoodupon her head. When she saw what a figure her Granny cut in bed, thepoor little thing was much surprised.'Oh!' cries she, 'how like you are to friend Wolf, Grandmother!''That's on account of my night cap, child,' replies the Wolf.'Oh! what hairy arms you've got, Grandmother!''All the better to hug you, my child.''Oh! what a big tongue you've got, Grandmother!''All the better for answering, child.''Oh! what a mouthful of great white teeth you have, Grandmother!''That's for crunching little children with! 'And the Wolf opened hisjaws wide to swallow Blanchette.But she put down her head crying:'Mamma! Mamma!' and the Wolf only caught her little hood.Thereupon, oh dear! oh dear! he draws back, crying and shaking his jawas if he had swallowed red hot coals.It was the little fire coloured hood that had burnt his tongue rightdown his throat.The little hood, you see, was one of those magic caps that they used tohave in former times, in the stories, for making oneself invisible orinvulnerable.So there was the Wolf with his throat burnt, jumping off the bed andtrying to find the door, howling and howling as if all the dogs in thecountry were at his heels.Just at this moment the Grandmother arrives, returning from the townwith her long sack empty on her shoulder.'Ah, brigand!' she cries, 'wait a bit!' Quickly she opens her sack wideacross the door, and the maddened Wolf springs in head downwards.It is he now that is caught, swallowed like a letter in the post.For the brave old dame shuts her sack, so. and she runs and emptiesit in the well, where the vagabond, still howling, tumbles in and isdrowned.'Ah, scoundrel! you thought you would crunch my little grandchild! Well,to morrow we will make her a muff of your skin, and you yourself shallbe crunched, for we will give your carcass to the dogs.'Thereupon the Grandmother hastened to dress poor Blanchette, who wasstill trembling with fear in the bed.'Well,' she said to her, 'without my little hood where would you be now,darling?' And, to restore heart and legs to the child, she made her eata good piece of her cake, and drink a good draught of wine, after whichshe took her by the hand and led her back to the house.And then, who was it who scolded her when she knew all that hadhappened?It was the mother.But Blanchette promised over and over again that she would never morestop to listen to a Wolf, so that at last the mother forgave her.And Blanchette, the Little Golden hood, kept her word. And in fineweather she may still be seen in the fields with her pretty little hood,the colour of the sun.But to see her you must rise early.(17)(17) Ch. Marelles
