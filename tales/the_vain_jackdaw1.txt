Jupiter announced that he intended to appoint a king over the birds,and named a day on which they were to appear before his throne, when hewould select the most beautiful of them all to be their ruler. Wishing tolook their best on the occasion they repaired to the banks of a stream,where they busied themselves in washing and preening their feathers. Thejackdaw was there along with the rest, and realized that, with his uglyplumage, he would have no chance of being chosen as he was. So he waitedtill they were all gone, and then picked up the most gaudy of the feathersthey had dropped, and fastened them about his own body, with the resultthat he looked gayer than any of them.When the appointed day came, the birds assembled before Jupiter'sthrone. and, after passing them in review, he was about to make thejackdaw king, when all the rest set upon the king elect, stripped him ofhis borrowed plumes, and exposed him for the jackdaw that he was.
