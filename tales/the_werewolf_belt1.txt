Formerly there were people who could turn themselves into wolves byputting on acertain belt. A man in the vicinity of Steina had such a belt, and oncehe wentaway without locking it up, as was his custom. His young son came upon itandbuckled the thing about himself. Instantly he became a werewolf. He hadtheappearance of a stack of pea straw and lumbered away heavily like abear.When the people in the room saw what had happened they ran quickly andbroughtback the father. He arrived barely in time and undid the strap before theboycould do any damage. Afterward the boy said that as soon as he put thebelt on,he become so terribly hungry that he would have torn anything apart thatmight have gotten in his way.
