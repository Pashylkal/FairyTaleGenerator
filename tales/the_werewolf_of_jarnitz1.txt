In the vicinity of Jarnitz there lived a werewolf who had the ability totransform himself into all kinds of different shapes. This werewolfspent the nights stealing sheep from their enclosures, for in those daysthe sheep were kept at night in enclosures in the open fields. Forseveral nights in a row the shepherd, armed with a loaded gun, had keptwatch for the night robber. He had already hit the werewolf severaltimes, as he had clearly seen, but the bullets seemed to have done him noharm, and he had escaped with his booty every time. Then the shepherdloaded his gun with bullets made of inherited silver, which neverfail. Thus this time he would be successful.Following his custom, the werewolf appeared again that night. But as hewas approaching the enclosure, he immediately sensed that this time theshepherd might do him in. Therefore he quickly turned himself into ahuman, walked up to the shepherd, and said to him in a familiar tone,"You don't have to shoot me dead!" That so unsettled the shepherd thathe lowered his gun, which he had been aiming at the intruder.The werewolf never again dared to steel sheep from the Jarnitz enclosures.
