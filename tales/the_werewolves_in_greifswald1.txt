Two hundred years ago for a time there was a frightfully large number ofwerewolves in the city of Greifswald. They were especially prevelant inRokover Street. From there they attacked anyone who appeared outside oftheir houses after eight o'clock in the evening. At that time there werea lot of venturesome students in Greifswald. They bandedtogether and one night set forth against the monsters. At first theywere powerless against them, until finally the students brought togetherall of the silver buttons that they had inherited, and with these theykilled the werewolves.
