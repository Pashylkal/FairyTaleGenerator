In the Skrzynka Woods, which are part of Wyrth Forest in the Stargardtregion, there is a high mountain named Buller Mountain. The WildHuntsman frequents this mountain on St. Bartholomew's Night (August 24).Many people have experienced how he rides through the woods with afrightful clamor.One time the head forester of the district was passing through thesewoods on this night, and he heard the noise. In the belief that he waspursuing some poachers, he followed the sound. Although he exertedhimself to the utmost, he was unable to overtake the huntsmen, and heuttered a blasphemous curse. Suddenly there was a frightful commotionabove his head. He heard the words "Here is something for you from ourhunt!" and a human leg was thrown into his carriage.
