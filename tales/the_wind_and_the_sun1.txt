The Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger. Suddenlythey saw a traveller coming down the road, and the Sun said, "I see a wayto decide our dispute. Whichever of us can cause that traveller to take offhis cloak shall be regarded as the stronger. You begin."So the Sun retired behind a cloud, and the Wind began to blow as hardas it could upon the traveller. But the harder he blew the more closely didthe traveller wrap his cloak round him, till at last the Wind had to giveup in despair.Then the Sun came out and shone in all his glory upon the traveller, whosoon found it too hot to walk with his cloak on.Kindness effects more than severity.
