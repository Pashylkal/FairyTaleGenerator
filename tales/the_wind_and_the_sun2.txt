Once the Wind and the Sun disputed as to which was the more powerful.And while they were quarreling, a man came by wrapped in a shawl andwearing a big pagri (head cloth or turban). And they said, "It isno good quarreling. Let us put our power to the test and see who candeprive this man of the shawl he has wrapped round him."Then the Wind asked to be allowed to try first and said, "You will seethat I will blow away the blanket in no time," and the Sun said, "Allright, you go first."So the Wind began to blow hard, but the man only wrapped his shawl moretightly round him to prevent its being blown away and fastened it roundhimself with his pagri . and though the Wind blew fit to blow theman away, it could not snatch the shawl from him. So it gave up, and theSun had a try. He rose in the sky and blazed with full force, and soon theman began to drip with sweat, and he took off his shawl and hung it on thestick he carried over his shoulder, and the Wind had to admit defeat.
