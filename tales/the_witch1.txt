A miller at a windmill near Wettin was for a long time unable to get amill hand, because the mill was haunted, and four workers had already diedthere, one after the other. He finally hired a high spirited boy. Atmidnight the boy was shaking out the grain when a small black cat crept upto him. A somewhat larger one followed, and the two of them grinnedsinisterly at him.The one said to the other, "I wish the big gray one would come."Soon thereafter a big gray cat arrived. As soon as it saw the boy itjumped at his throat. but with an ax the boy skillfully struck off halfits paw, which immediately turned into half of a woman's arm. Then thecats ran away.The next morning the boy waited in vain for his breakfast. He wentdownstairs and asked the miller why there was nothing to eat. The millerapologized, saying that his wife had turned deathly ill."Is she perhaps missing half an arm?" asked the boy. "If so, I can lendher one."And in truth one of the woman's arms was only half there, and thesevered piece fit onto the stump.Then it was known that she was a witch, and she was burned to death.
