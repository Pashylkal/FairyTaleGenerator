A chief had many horses, and among them a stallion which his wife oftenrode. The woman and stallion became enamoured of each other and cohabited.The woman grew careless of her household duties and always wanted to lookafter the horses.When the people moved camp, and the horses were brought in, it wasnoticed that the stallion made right for the woman and sniffed about heras stallions do with mares. After this she was watched.When her husband learned the truth, he shot the stallion. The womancried and would not go to bed.At daybreak she was gone, no one knew where. About a year after this itwas discovered that she had gone off with some wild horses. One day whenthe people were traveling over a large open place they saw a band ofhorses, and the woman among them. She had partly changed into a horse. Herpubic hair had grown so long that it resembled a tail. She also had muchhair on her body, and the hair of her head had grown to resemble a horse'smane. Her arms and legs had also changed considerably. but her face wasstill human, and bore some resemblance to her original self.The chief sent some young men to chase her. All the wild horses ranaway, but she could not run so fast as they, and was run down and lassoed.She was brought into her husband's lodge. and the people watched her forsome time, trying to tame her, but she continued to act and whinny like ahorse. At last they let her free. The following year they saw her again.She had become almost entirely horse, and had a colt by her side. She hadmany children afterwards.
