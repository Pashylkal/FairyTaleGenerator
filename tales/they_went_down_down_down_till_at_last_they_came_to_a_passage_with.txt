The eldestPrincess opened it, and they found themselves immediately in a lovelylittle wood, where the leaves were spangled with drops of silver whichshone in the brilliant light of the moon.They next crossed another wood where the leaves were sprinkled withgold, and after that another still, where the leaves glittered withdiamonds.At last the Star Gazer perceived a large lake, and on the shores ofthe lake twelve little boats with awnings, in which were seated twelveprinces, who, grasping their oars, awaited the princesses.Each princess entered one of the boats, and Michael slipped into thatwhich held the youngest.
