Folk Tales and Fairy Lore in Gaelic andEnglishLong ago a poor woman happened to call in a house near Torr a Bhuilg. Atthe time there was no one in the house but the housewife and whatappeared to be a little child. The child kept tumbling about on thefloor and screaming incessantly day and night.The poor woman asked what lad she had there on the floor. The housewifeanswered that she did not know. "Well," said the poor woman, "I knowwell what he is, and if you take my advice you will get rid of him. but,if not, you will get enough of him." The housewife said that she wouldtake her advice, and the poor woman then told her what she was to do to him.After the poor woman left, the housewife went out and brought in a basketof eggs, which she placed in a circle on the floor. While she was thusengaged, the lad kept looking sullenly at her, and said at length,roughly: "What are you doing in that manner?" "I am making a brewingcaldron," was the reply. "A brewing caldron? I am more than threehundred years old and I never yet saw a brewing caldron like that!"The housewife had no longer any doubt of the child being a fairy, but shewent about her business for a while in her usual way. Then she lookedout at the window and assumed a scared look and began to start back as ifshe beheld something dreadful. The squaller on the floor, lookingaskance at her for a while, at last asked what it was she beheld. "Isee," said she, "Torr a Bhuilg on fire." He waited where he was nolonger, but spring out at the door saying: "My hammers and my anvil andmy bellows," and after that he was never seen again.
