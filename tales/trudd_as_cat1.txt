For a long time a mill hand had been plagued every night by Trudd. Thenone night, following the advice of an experienced man, he took a sharpenedsabre to bed with him and stayed awake looking for what might come.Suddenly a cat crept up to the bed, then positioned itself to jump ontoit. It scarcely had its claws on the sideboard of the bedstead when themill hand struck with the sabre, cutting off the claws at their roots. Inthe same instant the cat disappeared.The next morning it was reported that the miller's wife was still inbed. It was said that during the night she had fallen down the cellarstairs and badly hurt her hands. In reality, however, all of her fingershad been cut off.
