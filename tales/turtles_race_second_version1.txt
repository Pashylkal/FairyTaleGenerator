Once a Turtle was resting itself on the surface of a lake, when hesaw something strange coming towards him. Not knowing whatit could possibly be, he went out to meet it, and when he cameclose to it, he found that it was a boat. When the men in the boatsaw the Turtle, they stopped and asked if he knew of anyone whowould race them around the lake. They said that they would payanyone who would beat them.The Turtle said, "I know one who would beat you.""Would you go and get him?" said the men.The Turtle said, "I am the one."So the men challenged him, but he would only race on one condition, and that was that he mightrun under the water and go around the lake close to the shore,and in order that they might know where he was he would tie a redribbon around his neck.The men then asked the Turtle what he would bet for the race, and the Turtle answered, "My life."Then the men said, "Well, tomorrow morning you get ready andcome around with that ribbon around your neck, and we willrace you."During the night the Turtle called together some of his brothers,and tied a red ribbon round each of their necks. Then he placedthem a distance apart all around the lake. In the morning theTurtle went to the place which they had picked out as their startingpoint, and found the men already there.When the word "go"was given, the boat started off and the Turtle dropped underneaththe surface of the water. When the Turtle rose to the surfaceagain, the boat was right abreast of him, and when the Turtlerose a second time, the boat people noticed that the Turtle wasgaining on them. When finally, the last Turtle rose, the boatwas only half way round.The Turtle won the race and got the reward.
