In Hiddestorf, not too long ago, therelived a widow who every Sunday was miraculously able to cook the mostdelicious meals. By the time that the servant girls had gone to church inthe morning, she had not yet made a fire, had not cleaned the vegetables,and had not even fetched any meat. But by the time church was finished,the best meal was on the table.Because that was not possible with ordinary powers, one Sunday a servanthid himself behind a large barrel in the kitchen in order to spy on thewoman.Just about the time the sermon was beginning there was a commotion in thechimney, and the devil came down and began to caress the woman. Afterwardhe started to fill the pots for her, but he suddenly stood still and said,"Woman, there are two eyes too many in here!" She denied it. "There aretwo eyes too many in here!" he said again, but when the woman began tomake fun of him, he filled the pots and disappeared up the chimney.At noon when everyone was seated at the table, the servant said, "I don'twant to eat, because I know that it came from the devil!"He had scarcely spoken when the Black One came in through the window,grabbed the woman by her braid, wrung her neck, and flew out the windowwith her.
