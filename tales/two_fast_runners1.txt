Once, a long time ago, the antelope and the deer happened to meet on theprairie. They spoke together, giving each other the news, each tellingwhat he had seen and done. After they had talked for a time the antelopetold the deer how fast he could run, and the deer said that he could runfast too, and before long each began to say that he could run faster thanthe other. So they agreed that they would have a race to decide whichcould run the faster, and on this race they bet their galls. When theystarted, the antelope ran ahead of the deer from the very start and wonthe race and so took the deer's gall.But the deer began to grumble and said, "Well, it is true that out here onthe prairie you have beaten me, but this is not where I live. I only comeout here once in a while to feed or to cross the prairie when I am goingsomewhere. It would be fairer if we had a race in the timber. That is myhome, and there I can run faster than you. I am sure of it."The antelope felt so glad and proud that he had beaten the deer in therace that he was sure that wherever they might run he could beat him, sohe said, "All right, I will run you a race in the timber. I have beatenyou out here on the flat and I can beat you there." On this race they bettheir dew claws.They started and ran this race through the thick timber, among the bushes,and over fallen logs, and this time the antelope ran slowly, for he wasafraid of hitting himself against the trees or of falling over the logs.You see, he was not used to this kind of traveling. So the deer easilybeat him and took his dew claws. Since that time the deer has had no galland the antelope no dew claws.
