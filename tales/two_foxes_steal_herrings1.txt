A man was one day walking along the road with a creel of herrings onhis back, and two foxes saw him, and the one, who was the biggest, said tothe other, "Stop here and follow the man, and I will run round and pretendthat I am dead."So he ran round and stretched himself on the road. The man came on, andwhen he saw the fox, he was well pleased to find so fine a beast, and hepicked him up and threw him into the creel, and he walked on. But the foxthrew the herrings out of the creel, and the other followed and pickedthem up. And when the creel was empty, the big fox leaped out and ranaway. And that is how they got the herrings.
