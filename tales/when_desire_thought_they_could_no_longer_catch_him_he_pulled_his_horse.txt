into a walk, like a prudent man who knows he has far to go. He travelledin this way for many weeks, passing by villages, towns, mountains,valleys, and plains, but always pushing south, where every day the sunseemed hotter and more brilliant.At last one day at sunset Desire felt the sun so warm, that he thoughthe must now be near the place of his dream. He was at that moment closeto the corner of a wood where stood a little hut, before the door ofwhich his horse stopped of his own accord. An old man with a white beardwas sitting on the doorstep enjoying the fresh air. The Prince got downfrom his horse and asked leave to rest.'Come in, my young friend,' said the old man. 'my house is not large,but it is big enough to hold a stranger.'The traveller entered, and his host put before him a simple meal. Whenhis hunger was satisfied the old man said to him:'If I do not mistake, you come from far. May I ask where you are going?''I will tell you,' answered Desire, 'though most likely you will laughat me. I dreamed that in the land of the sun there was a wood full oforange trees, and that in one of the oranges I should find a beautifulprincess who is to be my wife. It is she I am seeking.''Why should I laugh?' asked the old man. 'Madness in youth is truewisdom. Go, young man, follow your dream, and if you do not find thehappiness that you seek, at any rate you will have had the happiness ofseeking it.'
