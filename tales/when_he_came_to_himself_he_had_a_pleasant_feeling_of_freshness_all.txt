about him. It was night, the sky was sparkling with stars, and the earthwas covered with a heavy dew.The traveller having recovered, mounted his horse, and at the firststreak of dawn he saw a stream dancing in front of him, and stooped downand drank his fill.He hardly had courage to open his last orange. Then he remembered thatthe night before he had disobeyed the orders of the old man. Perhapshis terrible thirst was a trick of the cunning witch, and suppose, eventhough he opened the orange on the banks of the stream, that he did notfind in it the princess that he sought?He took his knife and cut it open. Alas! out of it flew a little canary,just like the others, who cried:'I am thirsty. give me something to drink.'Great was the disappointment of Desire. However, he was determined notto let this bird fly away. so he took up some water in the palm of hishand and held it to its beak.Scarcely had the canary drunk when she became a beautiful girl, tall andstraight as a poplar tree, with black eyes and a golden skin. Desire hadnever seen anyone half so lovely, and he stood gazing at her in delight.On her side she seemed quite bewildered, but she looked about her withhappy eyes, and was not at all afraid of her deliverer.He asked her name. She answered that she was called the Princess Zizi.she was about sixteen years old, and for ten years of that time thewitch had kept her shut up in an orange, in the shape of a canary.'Well, then, my charming Zizi,' said the young Prince, who was longingto marry her, 'let us ride away quickly so as to escape from the wickedwitch.'But Zizi wished to know where he meant to take her.'To my father's castle,' he said.He mounted his horse and took her in front of him, and, holding hercarefully in his arms, they began their journey.
