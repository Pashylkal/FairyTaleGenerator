offered his services. Now it happened that the garden boy had justbeen sent away, and though the Star Gazer did not look very sturdy,the gardener agreed to take him, as he thought that his pretty face andgolden curls would please the princesses.The first thing he was told was that when the princesses got up he wasto present each one with a bouquet, and Michael thought that if he hadnothing more unpleasant to do than that he should get on very well.Accordingly he placed himself behind the door of the princesses'room, with the twelve bouquets in a basket. He gave one to each of thesisters, and they took them without even deigning to look at the lad,except Lina the youngest, who fixed her large black eyes as soft asvelvet on him, and exclaimed, 'Oh, how pretty he is our new flowerboy!' The rest all burst out laughing, and the eldest pointed out that aprincess ought never to lower herself by looking at a garden boy.Now Michael knew quite well what had happened to all the princes, butnotwithstanding, the beautiful eyes of the Princess Lina inspired himwith a violent longing to try his fate. Unhappily he did not dare tocome forward, being afraid that he should only be jeered at, or eventurned away from the castle on account of his impudence.
