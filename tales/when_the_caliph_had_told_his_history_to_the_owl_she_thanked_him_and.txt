said: "Listen to my story, also, and hear how I am no less unfortunatethan thyself. My father is the king of India. I, his only, unfortunatedaughter, am called Lusa. That same sorcerer Kaschnur, who transformedyou, has plunged me also in this affliction. He came, one day, to myfather, and asked me in marriage for his son Mizra. My father,however, who is a passionate man, cast him down the steps. The wretchmanaged to creep up to me again under another form, and as I was onone occasion taking the fresh air in my garden, clad as a slave, hepresented me a potion which changed me into this detestable figure. Hebrought me hither, swooning through fear, and exclaimed in my ear withawful voice, 'There shalt thou remain, frightful one, despised even bybeasts, until thy death, or till one, of his own free will, evenunder this execrable form, take thee to wife. Thus revenge I myselfupon thee, and thy haughty father!'"Since then, many months have elapsed. alone and mournfully I live,like a hermit, in these walls, abhorred by the world, an abominationeven to brutes. Beautiful nature is shut out from me. for I am blindby day, and only when the moon sheds her wan light upon this ruin,falls the shrouding veil from mine eye."The owl ended, and again wiped her eyes with her wing, for thenarration of her wo had called forth tears. The Caliph was plunged indeep meditation by the story of the Princess. "If I am not altogetherdeceived," said he, "you will find that between our misfortunes asecret connection exists. but where can I find the key to thisenigma?"The owl answered him, "My lord! this also is plain to me. for once, inearly youth, it was foretold to me by a wise woman, that a stork wouldbring me great happiness, and perhaps I might know how we may saveourselves."The Caliph was much astonished, and inquired in what way she meant."The enchanter who has made us both miserable," said she, "comes onceevery month to these ruins. Not far from this chamber is a hall.there, with many confederates, he is wont to banquet. Already I haveoften watched them: they relate to one another their shamefuldeeds perhaps he might then mention the magic word which you haveforgotten.""Oh, dearest Princess!" exclaimed the Caliph: "tell us when will hecome, and where is the hall?"The owl was silent a moment, and then said: "Take it not unkindly, butonly on one condition can I grant your wish.""Speak out! speak out!" cried Chasid. "Command. whatever it may be, Iam ready to obey.""It is this: I would fain at the same time be free. this, however, canonly take place, if one of you offer me his hand." At this propositionthe storks seemed somewhat surprised, and the Caliph beckoned to hisattendant to step aside with him a moment. "Grand Vizier," said theCaliph before the door, "this is a stupid affair, but you can set itall right.""Thus?" rejoined he. "that my wife, when I go home, may scratch myeyes out? Besides, I am an old man, while you are still young andunmarried, and can better give your hand to a young and beautifulprincess.""Ah! that is the point," sighed the Caliph, as he mournfully droopedhis wings: "who told you she is young and fair? That is equivalent tobuying a cat in a sack!" They continued to converse together for along time, but finally, when the Caliph saw that Mansor would ratherremain a stork than marry the owl, he determined sooner, himself, toaccept the condition. The owl was overjoyed. she avowed to them thatthey could have come at no better time, since, probably, that verynight, the sorcerers would assemble together.She left the apartment with the storks, in order to lead them to thesaloon. they went a long way through a gloomy passage, until at last avery bright light streamed upon them through a half decayed wall. Whenthey reached this place, the owl advised them to halt very quietly.From the breach, near which they were standing, they could look downupon a large saloon, adorned all around with pillars, and splendidlydecorated, in which many colored lamps restored the light of day. Inthe midst of the saloon stood a round table, laden with various choicemeats. Around the table extended a sofa, on which eight men wereseated. In one of these men the storks recognised the very merchant,who had sold them the magic powder. His neighbor desired him to tellthem his latest exploits. whereupon he related, among others, thestory of the Caliph and his Vizier."What did you give them for a word?" inquired of him one of the othermagicians."A right ponderous Latin one MUTABOR."
