A certain boy and girl, whose names this tale telleth not, once livednear a church. The boy being mischievously inclined, was in the habit oftrying to frighten the girl in a variety of ways, till she became at lastso accustomed to his tricks, that she ceased to care for anythingwhatever, putting down everything strange that she saw and heard to theboy's mischief.One washing day, the girl was sent by her mother to fetch home thelinen, which had been spread to dry in the churchyard. When she had nearlyfilled her basket, she happened to look up, and saw sitting on a tomb nearher a figure dressed in white from head to foot, but was not the leastalarmed, believing it to be the boy playing her, as usual, a trick. So sheran up to it, and pulling its cap off said, "You shall not frighten me,this time."Then when she had finished collecting the linen she went home. But, toher astonishment   for he could not have reached home before her withouther seeing him   the boy was the first person who greeted her on herarrival at the cottage.Among the linen, too, when it was sorted, was found a moldy white cap,which appeared to be nobody's property, and which was half full ofearth.The next morning the ghost (for it was a ghost that the girl had seen)was found sitting with no cap upon its head, upon the same tombstone asthe evening before. And as nobody had the courage to address it, or knewin the least how to get rid of it, they sent into the neighboring villagefor advice.An old man declared that the only way to avoid some general calamity,was for the little girl to replace on the ghost's head the cap she hadseized from it, in the presence of many people, all of whom were to beperfectly silent. So a crowd collected in the churchyard, and the littlegirl, going forward, half afraid, with the cap, placed it upon the ghost'shead, saying, "Are you satisfied now?"But the ghost, raising its hand, gave her a fearful blow, and said,"Yes, but are you now satisfied?"The little girl fell down dead, and at the same instant the ghost sankinto the grave upon which it had been sitting, and was no more seen.
