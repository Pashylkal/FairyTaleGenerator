Gently?The Race of the Buffalo and the Hare.In olden times, so we are told by those who know best, there was constantstrife between the hares and the buffaloes. Each of them contended for thehonor of being the most swift footed.Both did run very fast, and neither would give in to the other. So it wenton year after year, and there seemed to be no end to the strife. Tired ofthis constant fight, one day the hare said to the buffalo, "Let us try arace together and settle this quarrel once for all."The buffalo was well contented with the proposal, and they agreed to raceone another. When the day came, the hare, putting his ears back, startedthe race. He ran so fast that you might have said he was flying upon theground.But the buffalo was a match for him. He went thundering away, his hoofssplashing the mud and raising seas of mire. The earth shook at his furioustread. He soon overtook the breathless hare which was running, panting asfast as its little legs could carry it.Then a thought struck the hare, and he cried to the buffalo, "Ho, friend!Take heed how you are thundering along. The earth is shaking, and if youare not careful, the earth will give way under you. See how it is rockingunder your feet."When the buffalo heard the hare's story, he stopped still for a whilebewildered, and then, being frightened, lest the earth should give wayunder him and he sink beneath, he checked his pace and began to walkslowly and tread gently.That was just what the hare had wanted, and pulling a long nose at thebuffalo, he ran swiftly by, leaving the buffalo a long way behind. Thus hewon the race, and there was no longer any strife between the hares and thebuffaloes.But ever since the buffalo walks slowly and treads lightly upon theground.
