One day the bear met the fox, who came slinking along with a string offish he had stolen."Whence did you get those from?" asked the bear."Oh! my Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught them," said the fox.So the bear had a mind to learn to fish too, and bade the fox tell him howhe was to set about it."Oh! it's an easy craft for you," answered the fox, and soon learnt.You've only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick your taildown into it. and so you must go on holding it there as long as you can.You're not to mind if your tail smarts a little. that's when the fishbite. The longer you hold it there the more fish you'll get. and then allat once out with it, with a cross pull sideways, and with a strong pulltoo."Yes. the bear did as the fox had said, and held his tail a long, long timedown in the hole, till it was fast frozen in. Then he pulled it out with across pull, and it snapped short off. That's why Bruin goes about with astumpy tail this very day.
