A number of hunters from Reutte went on a fox hunt in the "belt" betweenReutte and Heiterwang. They did not neglect to load something consecratedinto their weapons.After they had waited a long while, a fox finally came into view, andthey fired a heavy volley at it. The fox tumbled down, but then it gotback on its feet and fled. The hunters followed its tracks, which wereclearly visible in the snow.After they had followed the tracks for a good stretch, it suddenlyoccurred to them that the footprints left by the fox in the snow weregetting larger and larger, finally taking the form of human footprints.They could even clearly see that the tracks could have been made only byslippers.They could only imagine what all this had to do with the fox that theyhad shot at, but they continued to follow the tracks, which led themfinally to a house in the upper marketplace in Reutte. An old woman livedin this house, and she was lying in bed with a bullet wound in her body.
