Springs and wells of water have, in all lands and in all ages, beengreatlyvalued, and in some regarded with a feeling of veneration little, if atall, short of worship.They have yielded their treasure to the sustenance and refreshment of manand beast, as age after age of the world's history has passed along, and havebeen centers around which village story and gossip have gathered for generationafter generation. Little wonder, therefore, is it that legends and traditionsabound concerning them. These are often extremely local, and therefore littleknown.The names alone, however, suggest much. The memory of the mythical gods,satyrs, and nymphs of the ancient heathen times lingers in a few, as inThors kil or Thors well, in the parish of Burnsall. and in the almostuniversal declaration   by which not over wise parents seek to deter children fromplaying in dangerous proximity to a well   that at the bottom, under thewater, dwells a mysterious being, usually named Jenny Green teeth orPeg o' the Well, who will certainly drag into the water any child who approaches too near to it.The tokens of medieval reverence for wells are abundant. The names of thesaints to whom the wells were dedicated yet cling to them. "There isscarcely a well of consequence in the United Kingdom," says the editor ofLancashire Folk lore , "which has not been solemnly dedicated to some saint in the Roman calendar."Thus in Yorkshire we have Our Lady's Well or Lady Well, St. Helen's Well(very numerous), St. Margaret's Well at Burnsall, St. Bridget's Well near Ripon,St. Mungo's Well at Copgrove, St. John's Well at Beverley, St. Alkelda's Wellat Middleham, etc. Dr. Whitaker remarks that the wells of Craven, which bearthe names of saints, are invariably presided over by females, as was the casewith wells under the pagan ritual, in which nymphs exclusively enjoyed the samehonor.
